                    "For anyone, like me, who loves the mountains, Nepal is sacred ground. My blood starts to flow more freely when I leave the road behind, as the air starts to cool and the big peaks appear like giants on the horizon. In places such as Namche Bazaar, Kyanjin Gompa or Sama, you're truly on the threshold of some of the world’s greatest mountain scenery. On this recent trip, my favourite moment was reaching Pungyen Gompa, surrounded by glaciers, lakes and prayer flags at the foot of the world’s eighth-highest peak. It is one of the most beautiful places in the Himalaya and it feels like the end of the earth. Two hours later, I was back in my lodge, kicking back with a pot of Nepali tea, still hearing the sounds of the glacier echoing in my ears. Where else but Nepal can you get that?"

                    "Seasonal changes have a massive effect on river flows. Some rivers, such as the Sun Kosi, which is a full-on white-water trip in September and October, are basically flat in the low water of early spring. On the flipside, early spring can be a superb time to raft rivers such as the Marsyangdi, which would be suicidal during high flows. The Karnali is probably the only river that offers continually challenging white water at all flows, though during the high-water months of September and May, it’s significantly more challenging than in low-water months.",
                    "In general, September to early October and May to June bring high river flows, though not as high as the insane monsoon months of June to August, when most rivers are unrunnable. March and April bring warm weather and lower flows, with levels rising again in May. Mid-October to November is generally a great time to be on the river.",
                    "The shortest budget rafting trips take place on theupper Sun Kosi, on the old road to Tibet, and theTrisuli River, between Kathmandu and Pokhara. Both locations offer riverside camps of variable quality, but the downside is that you're never far from a major road. Between August and early October, the amiable Trisuli changes character as huge runoffs make the river swell and churn, so be sure to choose a reputable company during those months.",
                    "For a three- or four-day trip from Pokhara, consider theupper Kali Gandaki, starting from Beni or Baglung, or theMarsyangdi, starting in Ngadi, which offers two days of almost continuous white water and so requires lightly packed self-bailing rafts and an experienced rafting company.",
                    "Longer eight- to 12-day expeditions, such as theSun Kosi(September–April),Karnali(October–May) andTamur(October–December), offer some real heart-thumping white water with the sense of journey inherent in a long river trip. With more time on the river, things are more relaxed, relationships progress at a more natural pace, and memories become entrenched for a lifetime. River trips are much more than gravity-powered roller-coaster rides; they’re liquid journeys through some of the remotest corners of Nepal.",
                    "Bear in mind that all three of these rivers require long bus rides and/or flights to the start and/or end points in the remote far east or west of the country. The Tamur also requires a three- or four-day trek. Consider combining the Karnali with a visit to Bardiya National Park, or the Tamur with a trek to Kanchenjunga.",

Centuries of trade and cultural exchange with Tibet and India has further bequeathed the valley a remarkably seamless blend of artistic influences and religious practices.",

After crossing the bridge, the trail skirts the edge of paddy fields and a tall grey fence, past a small temple, before turning uphill, through a gate in the fence, into the forest. When you see the poultry farm on your left, you are near the gate. From here the trail climbs for about 2km through gorgeous forest that has regrown over old rice terraces. The main trail continues west in a more or less direct route to the pagoda. An alternative trail crosses the main trail about 600m from the gate and takes you up to the main ridge before turning west and skirting the north side of the ridge. This trail provides tree-framed mountain views. Eventually both trails meet up and you reach a restaurant where a little-used trail fromDevi’s Falls joins. Here there are spectacular views that keep getting better as you approach the pagoda. The approach is garrisoned by cafes tempting you with cold drinks and espresso coffee.

Spotted deer are often seen following the langurs around, taking advantage of their profligate feeding habits.

Despite occasional slaughter, such as when the British royals visited in 1911, the reserve status protected more animals than were killed. Population growth proved to be a more potent threat. Until the 1950s, the only settlements were small communities of Tharu, who were blessed with a degree of resistance to malaria. After a malaria eradication program in 1954, land-hungry peasants from the hills swarmed in and huge tracts of forest were cleared. As natural habitat dwindled, animals disappeared. By the mid-1960s, there were fewer than 100 rhinos and 20 tigers. When news of the decline reached King Mahendra, the area was declared a royal reserve. In 1973 it became a national park."

Generally, the bigger the group, the safer the walk, but the experience of your guide counts for a lot. Levels of experience vary and some of the guides have a worryingly devil-may-care attitude to creeping up on rhinos. Therefore, jungle walks aren’t recommended for the faint-hearted. Before you opt for a whole-day jungle walk, consider the very real risks associated with venturing deep into the park and being far from rescue and medical facilities, possibly without communication. Rules stipulate that two guides are required, even if there is only one customer.",

While much of the terrain is similar to Bardiya National Park, the extensive grasslands are a distinctive feature of Shuklaphanta. Visitor numbers to this national park are still very small,and facilities and accommodation more basic than those at Chitwan and Bardiya, and that is certainly part of its charm. Nevertheless, the reserve has around 40 tigers, 20 rhinos, crocodiles, wild elephants and Nepal’s largest population of swamp deer. There are also sizeable numbers of resident and migratory birds, including rare species such as the Bengal florican, which attract the more serious birdwatching crowd. Watchtowers are placed strategically near water sources – some natural, some created with groundwater using solar pumps.",

                    "The vibrant artwork produced by Maithili women can be traced back to the 7th century and has been passed from generation to generation since. Mithila painting is part decoration and part social commentary, recording the lives of rural women in a society where reading and writing are reserved for high-caste men. Scenes in Mithila paintings colourfully record the female experience of life in the Terai – work, childbirth, marriage and the social network among village women.",

You can still see houses in the villages surrounding Janakpur with painted walls. Mithila painting has taken off as a more contemporary and collectable art form, with women artists painting on canvases of handmade paper. Not only are Mithila paintings now exhibited in galleries across the world, but, more importantly, the art has also opened up a new industry for women in impoverished rural communities.",

It’s the terrestrial equivalent of spotting tropical fish on a coral reef. Every lodge has a resident ornithologist who leads bird-spotting walks around the reserve. Early morning, when the air is cool and the mist is lifting, and late afternoon as the sun varnishes the waters pink, are the prime birdwatching times and, birder or not, it’s hard not to enjoy the experience. Many lodges also offer morning or afternoon 4WD safaris and gentle river trips in a rubber dinghy, canoe or dhunga (wooden boat).",

                    "The Himalaya define Nepal, from its geography and climate to its history and culture, and there’s no better way to experience and understand the mountains than on foot, trekking trails that have been long used by porters, traders, pilgrims, mountaineers and locals, travelling from village to village, plains to hills, Nepal to Tibet.",
                    "Few things beat walking under a crystal-clear Himalayan sky, passing traditional mountain villages, Tibetan monasteries and glacial lakes, while staring open-mouthed at the world’s most impressive and tallest mountains. Spend some time getting to know the fascinating mix of people you meet en route, from welcoming Sherpa lodge owners to wily Tamang shop owners and cheerful Rai porters, and you have a depth of travel that draws people back to Nepal’s trails again and again.",
                    "Nepal sets the standard for hassle-free trekking, with trails in the Langtang, Annapurna and Everest regions lined with teahouses offering a hot meal, a cup of milk tea and a cheap bed at the end of grand day’s walk. Leave the tent behind, get a porter to carry your bag and settle back and enjoy the scenery.",
                    "Our best advice is not to rush your walk. Adding on a few days to your itinerary allows you to take in side trips, detours and monasteries, or simply take a day off every now and then. It’ll make all the difference."

From the pass, you have a knee-busting and sometimes slippery 1600m (four- to five-hour) descent toMuktinath(3800m). The hotels at sunnyChabarbu(4190m) make for a welcome rest stop on the descent.",

It will certainly aid your acclimatisation for the ascent over the Thorung La, but it shouldn’t be taken lightly, and we don’t recommend it for inexperienced trekkers. The narrow trail to Tilicho Base Camp crosses several unstable scree slopes. It’s easily the most dangerous section of trail on the Annapurna Circuit. If there’s snow, rain or high wind, it can be treacherous. Stones and boulders that become loose at the top of the slope pick up speed and shoot across the trail at astonishing speed and with lethal force. Leave space between team members and watch for ‘shooting’ stones."

In Upper Mustang, my family lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, living in tents made from yak wool and growing buckwheat and mustard whenever possible. But in the mid-1970s, with so many changes sweeping across the region, my family, in search of better opportunities, were once again on the move, this time to Pokhara, which was still a few decades away from being the bustling city it is today. Far from home and in completely different climatic conditions, my grandparents eked out a living working as carpet weavers. The town was where my parents met.

A beyul is both a physical and spiritual place and it’s said that they can only be accessed by a true and spiritually pure Buddhist after overcoming extreme hardships.

There are said to be 108 beyuls hidden throughout the Himalaya. Most are yet to be discovered but some are known about. Trekkers often find themselves walking through the physical location of a beyul without knowing it. The Tsum Valley, a side trip off the Manaslu Circuit trek, and the Rolwaling Valley are both considered beyuls. Helambu, just north of Kathmandu, is another. Of all the known beyuls though, the one that sees the most trekkers – and today seems the furthest from the ideal of a pristine and blessed secret valley – is the Khumbu region. The original centre of this beyul was the holy mountain of Khumbi Yul Lha (5761m), which rises up immediately behind Khumjung village. Today though, the spiritual heart of the Khumbu – and the beyul – is focused on the quiet Thame Valley."

                    "It’s one of the enduring myths of the Himalaya. A strange ape-like creature – possibly even a Neanderthal hominid – roaming remote Himalayan valleys. There have been reports of such creatures for hundreds of years. Today, most scientists believe the yeti to be a simple myth based on encounters with bears and, perhaps, a distant memory of the orang-utans that lived in Himalayan forests until 10,000 years ago, or even theGigantopithecus,a huge Asian ape that became extinct some 350,000 years ago and which almost exactly matches the classic yeti description (the only problem is that no bones from it have ever been discovered in the Himalaya). For many Himalayan peoples though, the yeti does still exist (in Bhutan, the government have even created a national park with the specific aim of protecting the yetis said to live there), but not quite in the classic Hollywood image. For most, the yeti is part spirit, part flesh-and-bones creature, and there are a couple of different kinds: a small one that lives in dense forests, and another, much larger and far more aggressive one, that lives higher up, close to the tree line and enjoys nothing more than snacking on yaks. If you do happen to encounter a yeti then, there are ways of escaping it. It’s said that if it’s a male yeti, then run uphill through dense scrub and its enormous penis will get caught up in the bushes and force it to stop the chase. If it’s a female, then run downhill and the weight of her huge breasts will cause her to fall over face first! Not that yetis are always inherently bad. There are a number of tales of yetis helping important religious figures. If you’re trekking to Everest Base Camp, pop by the Pangboche Monastery to see the yeti relics on display there, which are said to have come from a yeti that helped the Buddhist Master Lama Sange Dorje (who is said to have led the Sherpa people into the Khumbu region in the first place) as he meditated in a small cave high above Pangboche. Although the story is nice, unfortunately the monastery relics are proven fakes."

Yarsagumba is a bizarre combination of a fungus and caterpillar. The fungus infects and slowly kills and mummifies the larva of the ghost moth. This happens only for a few short weeks in very particular Himalayan pastures, at an altitude of between 4000m and 5000m, just before the arrival of the monsoon. Yarsagumba is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a general cure (not as a natural Viagra as some Western media reports state) and its recent surge in popularity has meant that at times in recent years, a kilo of yarsagumba is worth more than a kilo of gold. In fact, it has at times been the single most valuable natural product in the world. During the yarsagumba season, highland villagers flock to certain pastures to search for yarsagumba and – although the villagers receive nothing like the market value – it has created enormous wealth in some areas. Although, whether it actually has any health benefits is almost as unproven as the existence of yetis and beyuls.",
                    "In the end, whether the yeti is a flesh and blood creature or not, whether beyuls exist and whether yarsagumba really has a positive health impact, is irrelevant. What matters is that people in the Himalaya believe these things to be true and so, in effect, they become so."

                    "NEPAL HAS MADEsignificant progress in certain areas of development in recent years despite a civil war, earthquakes and less-than-perfect governance – so much so that Nepal is on target to graduate from United Nations Least Developed Country status in 2026. While economists will concern themselves with what this means in terms of trade, some grassroots groups remain concerned with the seemingly intractable challenges that rapid development and population growth have brought. Although the rate of growth has slowed in recent years, Nepal’s population of around 30 million has roughly doubled since 1980. Migration from rural areas to cities continues unabated, and traffic congestion and air and water pollution are all too obvious in Kathmandu, which has the dubious distinction of being among the world’s 10 most polluted cities.",
                    "Historically, economic development comes at a huge environmental cost – the full impact is often a faded memory for those in developed countries. Those affected aren’t just the other species that share the planet with humans – there are also significant impacts on the people at the bottom of the pile. Soil, air and water pollution disproportionately affect the poor and powerless. Thanks to a vocal free press, Nepal’s grassroots activism, whether it be addressing women’s rights, pollution, ordeforestation, continues to grow and be heard. Check out Nepal’s print and online news services, many in English, and you will quickly appreciate that they are generally more independent and outspoken on sensitive issues than many Western equivalents.",
                    "Nepal is blessed and burdened by its remarkable environment. The often-daunting landscape has hindered development because of the logistical challenges of bringing roads, electricity, healthcare and education to remote communities. Annual monsoons and infrequent but inevitable earthquakes test, and often demolish, human attempts to tame nature. As technology aids development in remote ecosystems, the country is faced with environmental threats.",
                    "In 2022, as the Upper Tamakoshi hydro power scheme came online, Nepal became self-sufficient in electricity. Soon the country will be exporting renewable energy, potentially helping neighbouring countries to reduce their own carbon footprints – a huge leap from the days of constant power shedding that many will remember. These run-of-river hydro projects have less environmental impact than huge impoundments and are fittingly admired in Nepal. Nevertheless, the dams, tunnels and roads required are not free from ecological consequence, as evidenced along the Marsyangdi River on the Annapurna Circuit trek."

The country now has 12 national parks, one wildlife reserve, six conservation areas and, somewhat incongruously, one hunting reserve. Including the 13 buffer zones around the national parks, just over 23% of the country enjoys some degree of environment and wildlife protection. Nepal can boast some remarkable achievements in wildlife conservation. The one-horned rhinoceros (gaida) is the largest of the three Asian rhino species, and in the early 1900s, only a couple of hundred individuals remained; now the population across India and Nepal is around 4000. The other signature species that has rebounded is the Bengal tiger (bagh). The most recent census has 355 tigers in Nepal, spread across Chitwan National Park (128), Bardiya National Park (125), Parsa National Park (41), Shuklaphanta National Park (36) and Banke National Park (25). This surpasses a goal set in 2010 to double Nepal’s tiger population by 2022.",
                    "The first protected areas were imposed by the government without consulting the local populations. More recent initiatives have concentrated on accommodating people’s needs in park buffer zones, rather than simply evicting them from the land. Many protected areas are surrounded by buffer zones of community-owned forests, the owners of which harvest natural resources and thus have a stake in their continued existence. These forests come with their own set of challenges, though. As human and wildlife numbers increase, encounters between the two also increase. Human–wildlife conflict is a fact of life for the people eking out a living on a park’s periphery. Tiger attacks have increased significantly, particularly in the community forests around Chitwan and Bardiya National Parks. Some estimates indicate an average of three attacks per month, the majority of which are fatal."

Most experts agree that rainfall patterns and intensity have changed in recent decades.",
                    "In the mountains, the flood risk comes from a different source. Rising global temperatures are melting the Himalayan glaciers, swelling glacial lakes to dangerous levels. In 1985, a natural dam collapsed in the Thame Valley, releasing the waters of the Dig Tsho and sending floods along the Dudh Kosi Valley. Scientists are monitoring the Imja Tsho in the Chhukung Valley. Since 1960, the lake has grown by over 34 million cubic metres, increasing the threat of rupture, which experts predicted would cause a ‘vertical tsunami’ through one of the most heavily populated and trekked parts of the Himalaya. In 2016, the Nepalese Army constructed an outlet and drained more than 4 million cubic metres of water from the lake. It’s not a solution, but rather a mitigation of a potential disaster, and a pilot project for reducing risks in other glacial lakes."

It’s tangible in the architecture, in temple carvings featuring mingled masses of Hindu gods and Buddhist bodhisattvas (enlightened beings), and in festivals honouring deities with dual personalities, revered equally by Hindus and Buddhists.",

Hinduism has been followed in Nepal for at least three millennia, and Lumbini in southern Nepal was the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama, the prince who would become the Buddha after attaining enlightenment at Bodh Gaya in the 5th or 6th century BCE.",
                    "At various times, different areas of Nepal have been predominantly Hindu or predominantly Buddhist, but neither faith has ever fully eclipsed the other. With Nepal’s unique position on the trade route between Tibet and the Indian plains, both faiths were continually reseeded by traders, spiritual thinkers and empire-building invaders.",
                    "Even the Buddha’s birthplace at Lumbini – one of Buddhism’s most sacred sites – was rescued from ruin twice, once in the 3rd century BCE by the Indian emperor Ashoka, and again in the modern era, when German and Nepali archaeologists rediscovered the site in 1896, leading to an explosion of new monastery construction.",
                    "Wandering holy men also played their part, spreading groundbreaking ideasabout the nature of existence as they drifted across the Himalaya. The first seeds of Buddhism in Tibet were planted by mendicant monks from Bihar, who honed their understanding of Buddhism’s universal truths in the mountains of Nepal.",

                    "Buddhist ideas also travelled south across the Himalaya. The 7th-century Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo took a consort from the Nepali Licchavi dynasty and converted to Buddhism, founding the stupa at Bodhnath at a time when Hinduism and Buddhism were jostling for authority in Nepal.",
                    "The plains of northern India – particularly the area around Bodh Gaya in Bihar – formed a vital crucible for both Hinduism and Buddhism, but Nepal was the mixing room, where ideas were shared, reframed and reinvented by some of history’s most influential thinkers, in a centuries-long meeting of philosophical minds.",
                    "Nepal’s tortuous topography made the kingdom a natural haven for persecuted beliefs. From the Licchavis to the Mallas, most of Nepal’s great dynasties came to the mountains for refuge as their territories crumbled in the Indian plains.",

Invaders from the Bengal sultanate raided Kathmandu in the 14th century, and the British seized Sikkim and Darjeeling in 1816, but neither had a lasting impact on Nepali culture.",
                    "Early forms of Hinduism and Buddhism thrived in this mountain sanctuary. While patriarchal orthodoxies rose in the Indian plains, Hinduism in Nepal stayed close to its Tantric roots, placing heavy emphasis on shakti – female spiritual power – and the veneration of myriad mother goddesses through animal (and reputedly human) sacrifices. The tradition of depicting Buddhist bodhisattvas with female consorts is a direct homage to this Hindu tradition.",
                    "Somewhere in all this to and froing, Hinduism and Buddhism started to bleed together, until the boundaries between the two faiths became blurred. Hindu deities took on new identities as incarnations of Buddhist bodhisattvas, Buddhist practices infiltrated Hindu beliefs, and empire-building rulers courted both Hindus and Buddhists to entrench their control over the city-states of the Kathmandu Valley.",
                    "There’s no better demonstration of this cultural crossover than theKumari, Kathmandu’s living child goddess. A symbol of female spiritual power, the Kumari is revered as a living manifestation of the Hindu goddess Taleju, the patron deity of the Malla kings, but the Kumari’s Kathmandu residence was constructed as a Buddhistvihara(monastery), and each new Kumari is selected by a panel of Buddhist and Hindu priests and astrologers.",
                    "Many gods are worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists. Bhairab, the most fearsome incarnation of the Hindu god Shiva, is venerated by Buddhists as adharmapala– a frightening deity charged with protecting the dharma and scaring away the forces of ignorance (a role also fulfilled by Bhairab in Hindu philosophy).",
                    "Similarly, Seto Machhendranath is worshipped by Buddhists as an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, and by Hindus as a manifestation of Shiva in the form of the 10th-century yogi Matsyendranath. Even the Buddha serves multiple roles, appearing as one of the incarnations of Vishnu in the Hindu pantheon.",
                    "This fusion of faiths comes to life in temple carvings across Nepal, particularly in the torana panels over temple doorways and the struts supporting the tiered roofs of Newari temples. Look closely at the carvings and statues in the Seto Machhendranath Temple and the Kumari Bahal in Kathmandu, and the great stupa at Swayambhunath, and you’ll discover a riotous medley of Hindu and Buddhist symbolism.",
                    "Wherever you encounter chaityas (stupas) in the Kathmandu Valley, take a look at the carvings below the dome. The Buddhistkumbha(dome) often rises above images of Hindu deities or a stylisedyoni, symbolising female sexual power in Tantric Hinduism. It’s a frozen-in-time snapshot from the evolution of the Hindu lingam (a phallic Shiva symbol), which inspired the Buddhist stupa, then later copied its rounded form."

                    "Nepal’s Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples offer a window into its soul, if you know what you are looking at. By Bradley Mayhew",
                    "VISITING A TEMPLEin Nepal can be a confusing and confounding experience. Bloodthirsty demons loom from the shadows and multilimbed goddesses threaten instant destruction, as otherworldly priests pour milk and oil over animal-headed statues amid swirling clouds of incense and a clatter of bells. And is that a pool of blood and chicken feathers in the corner?",
                    "Entering a monastery or temple in Nepal is to enter a sacred space populated by a pantheon of deities, at the meeting point of the sacred and the mundane. The more you can decode a temple’s visual language, the more things will make sense.",
                    "As you walk into a Tibetan monastery, for example, look up and you will notice that you are passing beneath golden statues of two deer and a wheel, representing the deer park at Sarnath where Buddha first gave his teachings, thus setting in motion the Wheel of Law. You will doubtless also pass amani lhakhang,a small building holding a giant prayer wheel carved with the Tibetan mantraommani padme hum(‘hail to the jewel in the lotus’) and stuffed with millions of printed paper prayers.",
                    "The main temple portico is a riot of cartoon-like murals – of the four guardian kings and also of the circular Wheel ofTime, a complex visual representation of the laws of karma and rebirth, with characters rising from torture-filled hells to heavenly upper realms. Inside thedukhang(main prayer hall), you’ll see statues of serene Buddhas, past, present and future, but also terrifying multiarmed demons, which you can see as representing aspects of the ego or negative emotions, and whose arms hold various visual symbols of Tantric psychological insight. You’ll also see princely bodhisattvas, beings who have gained enlightenment but spurned Nirvana to assist humankind.",
                    "Tantric symbols are everywhere here, from the ritual implements of the bell and thunderbolt, symbolising female wisdom and male compassion, used by monks during prayer services, to the hand mudras (positions) that help determine each deity. The altar itself overflows with offerings of food, fruit, seeds arranged in the shape of a mandala, and seven bowls of water, refilled daily.",
                    "Hindu temples are equally exotic, but here again there are clues to give you a toehold into understanding. A phallic-shaped lingam and vagina-like yoni, symbols of male and female power, tell you that you are in a Shiva temple, while a kneeling Garuda (mythical man-bird) indicates a temple is dedicated to Vishnu. Popular elephant-headed Ganesh, the god of prosperity and wealth, is probably the most easily recognised Hindu god, followed by the monkey god Hanuman, famous for his role in the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. Family relations are just as relevant in the god-world as in yours. Shiva is normally seen with his consort Parvati (herself in the form of peaceful Uma or fearsome Kali), whereas Vishnu is generally seen with his female counterpart, Laxshmi.",
                    "From here on, things get complicated. Vishnu alone has 10 separate incarnations, including Krishna and Rama. Shiva can appear as Pashupati, the Lord of the Beasts; Nataraja, the cosmic dancer; or as Bhairab the terrible, who himself boasts 64 different manifestations.",
                    "Why do Nepalis visit a temple? For many reasons – to show devotion, pray for good luck, to gaindarshan(which means both viewing, and being viewed by, a god) and to giveprashad,the offerings of dried coconut, marigolds and vermilion powder that you’ll see for sale outside every temple, while receiving a dot-like tikka blessing on their foreheads in return. During pujas (religious ceremony or prayers), the temple’s images are washed, dressed, fed and put to bed by their priest, just as if they were living beings.",
                    "Even if you’re armed with a guidebook-full of knowledge, Nepali temples can constantly surprise you. The eyebrow-raising erotic art carved on many temple roof struts always comes as a shock. I personally found myself lost for words when introduced to the temple guardian of Patan’s Golden Temple, an octogenarian tortoise that potters around the temple courtyard completely undisturbed."

                    "Classical Tibetan culture thrives in parts of Nepal, but China keeps a close eye on the situation. By Stuart Butler",
                    "AT THE HEADof the valley, a wall of 6000m-high glaciated peaks looks down onto a cluster of stone houses huddled tightly around the blood-red, fortress-like walls of a Tibetan Buddhist monastery. It’s a classic image of highland Nepal and if – like so many people do – you were to spend the majority of your time in Nepal up in the mountains, it would be easy to fall into the trap of thinking the country was a predominately Tibetan Buddhist nation. This, though, is far from the truth. The vast majority of Nepal’s population are Hindu, or (in the Kathmandu Valley in particular) they share Hindu and Buddhist beliefs in cultures that entwine to create something unique. It’s only up in the higher parts of the mountains, and in certain enclaves around the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara, that a strongly Tibetan culture thrives.",
                    "In many of the mountain areas, and especially on the leeside of the Himalaya, the culture is, and long has been, truly Tibetan. In lower areas, the arrival of Tibetan culture has been more recent and has come both through trade and recent political upheavals in Tibet."

                    "The area that most of us know as Tibet today is the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. However, historically Tibet has sometimes been much larger (and at times smaller), and Tibetan culture and belief has spread far beyond the borders of the Tibet Autonomous Region. There are several parts of the Nepali Himalaya where the locals previously looked more to Lhasa (capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region) than they did to Kathmandu for trade, religion and culture. The best known such area in Nepal is Upper Mustang, a former Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom on the northern side of the Annapurna Range. With Tibetan culture and religion being so heavily suppressed in the Chinese Tibetan regions, Upper Mustang is now often touted as the best place to experience traditional Tibetan culture (though even here, the arrival of roads is causing traditional lifestyles to change fast). Other, harder to reach, but perhaps even more authentically traditional Tibetan enclaves within Nepal include the Dolpo region, the Tsum Valley (off the Manaslu Circuit), the Nar-Phu Valley (off the Annapurna Circuit) and, perhaps the place that best guards classical Tibetan culture, the Limi Valley in the remote far northwest of the country. In all of these areas, local communities have the freedom to practice Tibetan Buddhism and live an often very traditional lifestyle. In most respects then, if you want to experience classical Tibetan culture, all of these places are now better spots to look than Tibet itself."

                    "As the political situation in the Chinese parts of Tibet has complicated (if not made impossible) access to important Tibetan Buddhist pilgrimage sites such as the Jokhang temple in Lhasa, the Samye Monastery and Mt Kailash for many Tibetans, the importance of Tibetan Buddhist sites within Nepal has increased. In recent decades, the sublime Bodhnath Stupa on the edge of Kathmandu has become the de facto centre of Tibetan Buddhist religious belief and culture in Nepal. No visitor to the country interested in Tibetan culture should miss the evening kora (circumambulation performed as a pilgrimage). The Swayambhunath Stupa, just to the west of Kathmandu’s tourist district, Thamel, is also of great importance to both the Tibetan community and the local Newari people. The third key site of importance for Tibetans in the Kathmandu Valley is the Namobuddha Stupa. Throughout the country, there are various important Tibetan Buddhist monasteries. These include the Tengboche Gompa, which trekkers heading to Everest Base Camp stride right past, various monasteries in Upper Mustang, and Shey Gompa in Dolpo. Just outside of Pokhara, the huge monastery in the settlement of Tashi Palkhel is the focus for Tibetans living around the lakeside city."

                    "After the 1950 Chinese invasion of Tibet, and the exile of the Dalai Lama in 1959, after which the occupation turned violent, huge numbers of Tibetan refugees arrived in Nepal, and today there are around 20,000 Tibetan refugees living in designated camps (which are now essentially towns) around Kathmandu and Pokhara. At first, the Nepali authorities were very welcoming of Tibetan refugees. A Tibetan freedom-fighter movement (part funded by the CIA) even based itself in Upper Mustang.",
                    "However, as China has grown ever stronger, and Nepal ever more reliant on Chinese aid and development, China has exerted more pressure on Nepal to crack down on pro-Tibet feelings and prevent Tibetans crossing into Nepal. Today, though Tibetan refugees living in Nepal have a lot more freedoms than they would have in Chinese-administered Tibet, they don’t have the same rights and freedoms as most Nepalis. According to Human Rights Watch, since 2008 Nepal has increased surveillance of Tibetans in the country and signed intelligence-sharing agreements with China. In addition, most Tibetan refugees arriving in Nepal since 1990 have been unable to get a Nepali identity card, without which many public services are unavailable to them."

                    "Nepal is home to the world’s second-largest Tibetan refugee population. By Tsering Lama",
                    "WHEN THE FIRSTgeneration of the country’s Tibetan refugees started arriving in 1959, many didn’t think they would stay in the country for long. But more than six decades later, despite carrying the sincere hope of returning to their home country, the community has now taken a more permanent semblance. Today, about 20,000 Tibetans, many second-, third- and fourth-generation refugees, call Nepal ‘home’.",
                    "While the tourist city of Pokhara has the highest number of Tibetan settlements, Kathmandu has the largest Tibetan refugee population, with the important Buddhist sites of Bodhnath and Swayambhunath being the largest enclaves.",
                    "If there is one place that I always recommend to those looking for a Tibetan experience in Kathmandu, it has to be Bodhnath. The place is dubbed as Nepal’s ‘Little Tibet’ for a reason. The Bodhnath Stupa is at the heart of Bodhnath’s Tibetan community. From dawn to late into the evening, elderly and young Tibetans can be seen circumambulating the stupa (an act that is called kora, which in Tibetan means ‘to take rounds’) and reciting Buddhist mantras. Take a walk into one of the many narrow alleys that connect the stupa to the larger Bodhnath area and you will find Tibetan-owned eateries, all of which have two things in common: a smiling poster of the Dalai Lama and a menu that featurestraditional Tibetan delicacies of steaming bowl ofthukpa(noodle soup), momos (dumplings) and salted butter tea. The alleys are also home to shops selling ornate Tibetan Buddhist wares.",
                    "If you find yourself in Pokhara, Tashi Palkhiel Tibetan settlement is the place to be. The largest of its kind in the town, the scenic camp is sandwiched between two glacier-fed rivers and flanked by gorgeous snowcapped mountains.",
                    "Like many major Tibetan refugee camps in the country, Tashi Palkhiel has its own school; a showroom selling traditional Tibetan carpets; an auditorium that hosts the community’s major social and cultural gatherings; and health clinics that practise both modern medicine and Sowa Rigpa (traditional Tibetan medicine).",
                    "Visit the settlement during Losar (Tibetan New Year; February/March) to witness a truly festive atmosphere. As the diaspora’s biggest festival, the new year is celebrated in Nepal with fervour, with traditional Tibetan dance performances.",
                    "Despite having lived in the country for more than 60 years, Nepal’s Tibetan diaspora has been able to protect its unique culture and language, largely thanks to the network of Tibetan settlement camps and schools. The majority of school-age children attend Tibetan schools, which play an essential role in teaching youngsters the Tibetan language, engaging them in cultural activities, and instilling the need to preserve their culture and unique identity.",
                    "For decades, Nepal’s Tibetan diaspora relied heavily on the Tibetan carpet industry for employment. Many from the community were engaged in carpet businesses and were employed local Tibetans. The carpets were mainly exported to North America and Europe but business has been dwindling since the 2000s, forcing many to look elsewhere for business and employment opportunities elsewhere.",
                    "For many, those opportunities have been found abroad. In the last two decades, thousands of Tibetans from Nepal have, in the hopes of building a better future, migrated to the US, Canada, the UK and Europe. So many have moved abroad that the country’s Tibetan diaspora population has been on downward trend for many years now. Adding to the population decline is the fact that, since 2008, the number of new refugees crossing the land border into Nepal has also seen a sharp decline.",
                    "The majority of Nepal’s Tibetan population has never seen Tibet, and the only country its members have ever known is Nepal. Yet Tibet remains a cherished dream, a hope, and the only true home.",
