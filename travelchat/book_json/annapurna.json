                    "Annapurna is the goddess of abundance, a divine deity watching over her devotees with a benevolent smile. Rising from Pokhara or Mustang, the towering massif almost touches the heavens. Only the wildest dreams of nature could have sculpted such grandeur.",
                    "The Annapurna giants are sublime in all their moods – whether cast as beckoning temptresses, fiery demons at sunset, shimmering in the starry moonlight, or bathed in the soft light of dawn. They float like benign ghosts above fluffy clouds or appear as a vision of serenity reflected in the cool blue waters of a lake. Sometimes they are darkened by thunderous storms. Superlatives struggle to do justice to the sensational vistas and contrasting landscapes. It’s no wonder that trekkers and mountaineers are drawn, as if hypnotised, to these majestic peaks and their icy bastions.",
                    "For centuries Nepal was an isolated and forbidden land. What the early explorers found was paradise on earth, a lush and plentiful kingdom where the rhythms of life unfolded in daily rituals, tinged with strong religious beliefs. Today people are drawn to Nepal for many reasons: to seek the solitude of the wild, to scale the Himalayan giants, to seek out the elusive wildlife, or to look for a spiritual renaissance. For many the main attraction is the sheer beauty and variety of the mystical Himalayan landscapes. Others are content to delve into its historic byways, discovering the hidden shrines of the long-fabled Kathmandu Valley.",
                    "Today Nepal has become easily accessible and welcomes thousands of travellers each year. Few of them will return to their daily routines unchanged; exploring the country is challenging, both physically and mentally. The sights, sounds and smells of Nepal live on in the memory, and the trails of the Annapurnas are rightly the most popular trekking routes in this very special place.",
                    "The aim of this guide is to inspire adventure-seeking trekkers to go beyond the famil-iar, to explore the most mesmerising mountains in the world.",

                    "Misty moods: Dhaulagiri from Kopra (Trek 4)",
                    "First used in our Cicerone Mount Kailash trekking guide, this quotation is surely no less apt when applied to the Annapurnas. Of all the great Himalayan peaks, the Annapurnas are unique. They are not defined by a single soaring summit, but comprise a vast massif, encompassing multiple peaks, spires and impossibly high ridges. The whole range is about 60km in length, with four major peaks and many subsidiary summits. Even the most sedentary soul will wish to get closer, to explore the verdant valleys, discover the mysterious gorges and head for the high passes.",
                    "Trekkers come from far and wide to discover Annapurna. Many arrive full of barely controlled anticipation, seeking a new challenge. All will leave with a renewed inspiration for life – there is something truly uplifting about being among some of nature’s most magical arenas. Everyone will lament the poverty of the ‘developing’ world, but look deeper – do you see many unhappy faces? Nepal’s people are her greatest asset: hard-working, brimming with almost child-like humour, boisterous, endearing, versatile and hungry for change, just like most people across our planet.",
                    "Any journey in and around these mountains is a joy, with experiences to treasure for a lifetime. Routes lead around tranquil lakes, through rich farming country, forests of bamboo and rhododendron, cool rainforest, silent alpine glades and rugged, high mountain desert. In the villages, excitable children rush to practise their English. Elsewhere a Hindu god may catch your gaze, or you may hear the chanting of monks in a monastery clinging to a strangely eroded cliff. The Annapurnas may dominate the landscape, but the people and the culture will surprise and delight in equal measure.",
                    "This latest Cicerone guide to Annapurna discusses the impact of new mountain ‘roads’ on the trails. Initially it might be tempting to write off those areas that have experienced the internal combustion engine for the first time at close quarters. Change is happening in Nepal at a staggering pace, despite its underdeveloped status. However – and this must be stressed most emphatically – do not believe for one minute that the Annapurnas have lost their shine.",
                    "There are many new and exciting routes opening across the greater Annapurna region. The guide is divided into three parts, covering established routes, restricted area treks and new homestay trekking areas.",
                    "",
                    "",
                    "In April and May 2015 two powerful earthquakes struck Nepal, causing massive disruption to the country. Although many older houses and some historic temples were left in ruins, across Kathmandu the majority of buildings and infrastructure remained intact. Sadly the rural regions adjacent to the two quakes suffered more serious damage. The main areas affected were below the peaks of Manaslu, Ganesh Himal, Langtang, Gauri Shankar and parts of the Everest region.",
                    "The entire Annapurna region, including Upper Mustang and Nar-Phu, was miraculously spared any significant damage. The villages, lodges, trails, roads and hillsides were left intact; only a few isolated houses suffered. Transport links between Kathmandu and Pokhara, as well as along the main valleys of the Kali Gandaki and Marsyangdi in the Annapurna region, remain open and are functioning normally.",
                    "We were in Kathmandu during the month of May. Having become instant aid workers (buying up rice, tarpaulins, tin sheets and warm, locally made clothing using generous donations), we witnessed a remarkable few weeks in the country. After the first days of shock, thousands of local people, young and old, engaged in the relief and rebuilding process with amazing energy. There is no doubt that the resilient people of Nepal will be back on their feet well ahead of expectations.",
                    "There is no reason for any prospective trekker to the Annapurna region (and much of Nepal) to delay a trip to the Himalayas. The country certainly needs the tourism sector to blossom again as soon as possible. Your trek will help this to happen more quickly.",
                    "Anyone wishing to know how ‘amateur’ aid works can read ourEarthquake Diaries: Nepal 2015, published by CreateSpace/Amazon. (ISBN: 978 1 51506 316 2).",
                    "Most of the changes over recent years affect this route, so much of the guide concentrates on this trek, introducing some previously neglected side trips and new alternatives to walking on or close to the new ‘roads’. It remains the classic trek and is still a top trekking destination. Roads may change it but will not destroy it (after all, Switzerland has both side by side).",
                    "Another classic favourite where little change, other than ever-improving comfort, has occurred. The views from this cloud-bubbling cauldron are still hard to beat.",
                    "Affectionately known as the Poon Hill Expedition, this has all the ingredients for a short, spell-binding adventure in the foothills. Terraced hillsides, fairytale forests and soaring snow-covered spires contrive to make any visit a memorable one.",
                    "Once a hidden treasure, this route is gradually becoming more popular. Still mainly a camping option, its high isolated ridges will soon see an influx of trekkers, as community homestays open along its lower reaches. The airy belvederes of the Kopra Danda ridge are sensational; even the most experienced trekking hand will be blown away.",
                    "Many would-be explorers are drawn to the captivating Tibetan culture and the plateau’s fantastic scenery. In these remote mountains, specialist trekkers can delve into the natural world, capturing magnificent predators like lammergeyer on camera, tracking the bashful Himalayan bear, sniffing out the elusive snow leopard and even yearning for the yeti.",
                    "Mani wall in Mustang",
                    "Upper Mustang, with its extraordinary walled city of Lo Manthang, has long been the fabled Shangri-La. Getting there is every bit as fascinating and inspiring. Where in the world can you find such unbelievable variation – the highest peaks of the Himalayas, mysterious canyons, legend-filled settlements, staggering geology and contorted natural landscapes?",
                    "Perhaps the most astonishing region of all the Annapurnas, Nar-Phu is as barely known as it is inaccessible. Cut off for centuries by the highest passes and the most impenetrable, sheer-sided canyon in Nepal, the medieval villages of Nar and Phu are some of the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Trekking here takes one to a new level of adventure and wonder.",
                    "Long overlooked are two routes below Machhapuchhre: the Mardi Himal Trek and the Machhapuchhre Trek. Both climb above the tree line to the wild, rugged base camps of Mardi Himal.",
                    "Lower down the hillsides trekkers can enjoy close contact with local people and their villages; eco-friendly, cultural homestay treks are the new thing. West of Poon Hill on the sunny slopes above the Kali Gandaki River are the Parbat Myagdi treks. Not far from Pokhara is the Siklis Trek; once popular with camping groups, it remains a peaceful and traditional area. The Lamjung foothills – around Chowk Chisopani–Tandrangkot–Puranokot – are the latest area to introduce homestay trekking. A little further north, the Gurung Heritage Trail is sure to be enjoyed by increasing numbers of trekkers in the future.",
                    "The joy of discovering these routes must be tempered with some words of warning: no trek to the remote Himalayan region can be underrated in terms of objective danger. Sections of this guide are devoted to the essential advance planning that is required by any potential visitor, especially because of the isolation, difficulty of access, and sheer ‘different-ness’ of the destination.",
                    "Having spent over half our lives trekking in Nepal, we have never tired of the Himalayas. Our youthful romantic notions about these distant, lofty peaks have not dwindled with age – we find ourselves drawn to these mountains, time and time again. It is an addiction that is hard to shed, so beware – you too may find that the ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ trek becomes habit-forming!",
                    "Climbing from Putak with the Thorong La in view (Trek 1)",
                    "Stretching over 2500km from the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh in the east to Pakistan in the west, the Himalayas form an unbroken chain that divides the plains of India from the Tibetan plateau. Nepal is 250km wide on average and roughly 800km in length. The country’s highest peaks, from east to west – Kangchenjunga, Makalu, Everest, Lhotse, Annapurna and Dhaulagiri, all exceeding 8000m in height – are located along its northern borders.",
                    "From fossil records in Nepal and Tibet, it is estimated that a sea existed in this area about 100 million years ago. At some time in the following 50 million years India began to ‘collide’ with Tibet through the process of plate tectonics. Some 40–45 million years ago, the Indian plate continued its northward march, forcing the Tibetan plateau upwards. Around 20 million years ago, the main Himalayan chain was formed by the same process. The Himalayas have continued to rise over the last two million years.",
                    "Nepal’s border region with India, a narrow, once-malarial jungle strip called the Terai, has been cleared for agriculture and today provides the majority of the population with food. Rising abruptly from the plains of India are the Siwalik Hills: dramatic, steep, yet fragile, being easily denuded by the heavy rains. The steep and forested Mahabharat Hills, rising to over 3000m, mark the southern edge of the middle hills of Nepal, where most of the rural population lives. Most visitors trek through this area – home to the valleys of Kathmandu and Pokhara – marvelling at the impressive farming terraces and rolling hills dotted with quaint houses.",
                    "The Himalayan mountains comprise a relatively small zone along the northern border with Tibet/China, but are the visual focus of the whole country. The main Himalayan range is not a watershed; dynamic fast-flowing rivers cut through these mountains, giving access to the inner sanctuaries of the peaks. The main watershed ranges are north of the Nepal Himalayas in Tibet – equally astonishing and alluring mountains – with an altitude range of roughly 3000–8848m (the summit of Everest).",
                    "",
                    "The Himalayas are an amazing natural barrier that divides the main weather systems of Asia, affecting the climate in a unique manner. The southern Indian plains experience hot, humid monsoon patterns in the northern hemisphere summer, with cooler, dry, high-pressure-dominated winter periods. In Tibet to the north the climate is harsh, cold and windy. The mountains cause a rain shadow creating a desert-like region, with only the far south of Tibet experiencing any influence of the monsoon. The Annapurna range sits between these two extremes, making a trek in the south very different from one in the north. It is these contrasting climates that make the Annapurna Circuit trek one of such variety. For the specific effects of the climate on trekkers see‘When to go’.",
                    "Poinsettia",
                    "Nepal is a paradise for botanists. With so many climatic zones, it’s no surprise to find that there are in excess of 6500 different types of plants, flowers, trees, grasses and growths of all dispositions across the country. Many of the plants favoured by gardeners in the West have their origins in the Himalayas; Joseph Hooker, a noted 19th-century explorer and botanist, discovered many of these as he explored Sikkim and eastern Nepal.",
                    "Rhododendron",
                    "The lowland jungles and slopes of the Siwalik foothills are home to sal trees, simal, sissoo, khair and mahogany. Hugging the Mahabharat ranges and higher you find the ubiquitous pipal and banyan trees, like an inseparable couple shading porter rest-stops (chautaara). Chestnut, chilaune and bamboo occur in profusion, and in the cloud forests are a myriad of lichens, ferns, rattens and dripping lianas. The prolific orchids, magnolia, broadleaf temperate oaks and rhododendron (locally calledlaliguras) colonise the higher hillsides. Higher up are spruce, fir, blue pine, larch, hemlock, cedar and sweet-smelling juniper. Poplar and willow are found along the upper tree line; in the high meadows look out for berberis. Even in the highest meadows, hardy flowers and plants, such as colourful gentians, survive.",
                    "With such a wide variety of plantlife and breadth of climatic range Nepal is home to a diverse population of mammals, reptiles and birds. The lowland Terai is home to the spectacular Asian one-horned rhino, elephant, spotted deer and sambar deer, as well as the odd sloth bear, leopard and tiger, which are rarely seen. Gharals, marsh mugger crocodiles, alligators and snakes lurk in the murky waters of the lowland marshes and rivers that drain into the holy Ganges River. These once-thick jungles still host an amazing number of semi-tropical birds, despite clearance for agriculture. The middle hills are extensively cultivated, but still hide a variety of animals. Monkeys and langurs abound in the forests.",
                    "At altitude look for marmot, pika (small mouse-like animal, related to the rabbit), weasel, ermine, Himalayan hare, brown bear, wild dog, blue sheep, Tibetan sheep, wolf, thar (species of large deer) and the famed musk deer (a prized trading item in the past). Skittish wild ass, the kyang, are only found in the northern zones of Mustang and Nar-Phu. Wild yaks do still roam in isolated, remote valleys, but most are now domesticated. As well as the infamous butter tea, yak milk is also used by nomads to produce cheese and yoghurt. The dzo – a cross between a yak and a cow – is commonly used as a pack animal. Herders keep sheep and goats, as well as yaks. The snow leopard is rarely encountered and virtually never photographed. Hunting blue sheep in the dawn or twilight hours, they are extremely wary and unlikely to show themselves. Television crews with big budgets have waited many years to get any film of these beautiful creatures. If you see a yeti, do let us know!",
                    "Note that trekkers need not worry about encountering dangerous animals in the Annapurnas in general, although domestic guard dogs occasionally show more interest than is desirable.",
                    "(contributed by Rajendra Suwal, WwF Nepal)",
                    "The incredible diversity of the Annapurnas offers naturalists the perfect environment for discovering a wealth of birdlife. Its unique habitats shelter diverse groups of bird species. Birds move mostly in flocks, hunting insects at different levels in the forest. During quiet times you might spot 5–12 different species, determined by season. There are diurnal, seasonal and altitudinal migrants; birds such as the cuckoo visit during the spring for breeding.",
                    "As the first rays of sun hit theforests, the insects stir into life and the insectivores, including the colourful long-tailed minivet, and green-backed, black-lored and black-throated tits, begin foraging. Nectarine-, fruit-and berry-eating birds are active early in the day. Trees with berries or flowers are magnets for multiple species, namely whiskered, stripe-throated, rufous-naped and white-browed tits. The forest between Ghorepani and Tadapani is a good place to encounter the great parrotbill, spotted laughing thrush, and the velvet, rufous-bellied and white-tailed nuthatch.",
                    "The most rewarding forest habitats are those of Timang, Chame and Pisang, around Ghandruk, Tadapani, Ghorepani, Ghurjung and en route to Annapurna Base Camp. Try to catch a glimpse of the golden-breasted, white-browed and rufous-winged fulvetta. The forest is full of red-tailed, rufous-tailed and blue-winged minla. The tapping of the rufous-bellied, crimson-breasted and pied woodpeckers occasionally interrupts the silence. The forests are alive with the beautiful scarlet, spotted and great rose finch, along with the spot-winged grosbeak. Birdwatchers will be amazed to see tiny warblers, including chestnut-crowned, Whistler’s, black-faced, grey-hooded and ashy-throated warblers. Nepal cutia is found in forests of alder.",

Other common birds are the red-vented, black bulbul, great and blue-throated barbet, and also coppersmith barbet in the lower reaches. On some overhanging cliffs below Landruk, Chhomrong and Lamakhet near Siklis are honeycombs made by the world’s largest honeybees, where you may spot the oriental honeyguide.",

The blue pine forest is a habitat of the very vocal spotted nutcracker, while orange-bellied leafbirds prefer the upper canopies. More treasures are the tiny Nepal, scaly-breasted and pygmy wren babblers, feeding under the ferns, with their high-pitched territorial calls. With its high-pitched sound, the jewel-like, tiny chestnut-headed tesia is a wonderful bird to see in moist undergrowth.",

Migrating eagles, including the steppe and imperial, as well as small birds of prey, pied and hen harriers and common buzzards also use it. Observing the annual autumn migration of thousands of demoiselle cranes is very rewarding. To gain height and glide over the peaks, they catch the thermals in the windshadow of the mountains. If the weather turns bad, they wait in the buckwheat fields and riverbanks. The golden eagle, the master predator, anticipates their arrival and attacks the cranes in-flight, occasionally separating a young, injured or sick crane from the flock, catching them in the air. This epic migration was broadcast as part of the ‘Planet Earth’ Mountain Series on the BBC/Discovery Channel.",

Around 550BC, in Lumbini in southern Nepal, Prince Siddhartha Gautama was born, later becoming the Buddha, whose philosophy would have such an impact on the country. In the third centuryBC, Ashoka, one of the first emissaries of Buddhism in India, built the ancientstupas(a large Buddhist monument, usually with a square base, a dome and pointed spire) of Patan and the pillar in Lumbini. AroundAD300, during the Licchavi Period, the Hindu religion blossomed across the southern and middle hills. Trade routes flourished between Tibet and India, with Kathmandu being the most important trading centre.",
                    "When Buddhism declined in India, ‘adepts’ (masters of Buddhism) crossed the Himalayas to find refuge in Tibet. Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism later trickled back into Nepal, providing many of the fascinating aspects of the country’s religious life. The Buddhist master Padma Sambhava (Guru Rinpoche) travelled around the Himalayas in the eighth century. Few records exist of the period following until the 13th century, when the Malla kings assumed power.",
                    "The Malla period marks the golden age of art and architecture in Nepal, with the construction of multi-tiered palaces and pagodas. The people lived in decorated wood and brick houses. Jayasthiti Malla, a Hindu, consolidated power in the Kathmandu Valley and declared himself to be a reincarnate of the god Vishnu, a practice that was considered appropriate for the monarchs of Nepal until 2007. Jyoti Malla and Yaksha Malla enhanced the valley with spectacular structures. Around 1482 the three towns of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur became independent cities, with each king competing to build the greatest Durbar Square, parts of which still exist today.",

His forces swept in from the west, subduing the cities of the Kathmandu Valley and unifying Nepal. Nepalese armies invaded Tibet in 1788, but were later repulsed by Tibet with Chinese intervention. In 1816 the British defeated the Gurkhas and, in the treaty of Segauli, Nepal had to cede Sikkim to India, with the current borders delineated. The British established a resident office, but Nepal effectively became a closed land after 1816.",
                    "In 1846 a soldier of the court, Jung Bahadur Kunwar Rana, took power after a bloody massacre in Kot Square in Kathmandu. The queen was sent into exile and the king dethroned. For the next 100 years the Rana family ruled Nepal, calling themselves Maharajas. Family intrigues, murder and deviousness dominated the activities of the autocratic Ranas. The country remained closed to all but a few invited guests, retaining its medieval traditions until 1950.",
                    "After Indian independence in 1947, a Congress Party was formed in Kathmandu. The powerless king became a symbol for freedom from the Ranas’ rule. For those who dared to confront the Ranas, there was a terrible price to pay; many suffered the death penalty. King Tribhuvan finally ousted the Ranas in 1951.",
                    "A coalition government was installed, with a fledgling democracy. The country opened to visitors and Mount Everest was climbed in May 1953. King Tribhuvan died in 1955 and his son Mahendra assumed power. In 1960 Mahendra ended the brief experiment with democracy, introducing the party-lesspanchayatsystem, based on local councils of elders with a tiered system of representatives up to the central parliament. In 1972 King Birendra became the new king, but his coronation did not take place until the spring of 1975, on an auspicious date. In 1980 a referendum was held and the panchayat system was retained. After 1985, rapid expansion brought many changes; the population grew astonishingly, and the traditional rural lifestyle of the valley began to disappear under a wave of construction.",
                    "In April 1990 full-scale rioting and demonstrations broke out, forcing the king to allow a form of democracy to be introduced. But political corruption and infighting did little to enhance the democratic ideals, and in the late nineties a grass roots Maoist rebellion developed. Many had genuine sympathy with the need for greater social equality, but violence and demands for a leftist dictatorship met with resistance. In a tragic shooting spree in June 2001 King Birendra and almost his entire family were wiped out by his son, Crown Prince Dipendra. King Birendra’s brother Gyanendra became king, but in October 2002 he dissolved parliament and appointed his own government until elections could be held. Meanwhile the Maoist rebellion continued to threaten all parts of the country. Coercion and intimidation were rife in the countryside and no solutions were in sight.",
                    "King Gyanendra relinquished power in April 2006 and the Maoist leaders entered mainstream politics after winning a majority of votes in the election. Since then, the government of Nepal has been in freefall, with a political stalemate and paralysis derailing development. A new constitution was finally promulgated in September 2015, but it remains to be seen where the ruling elite will take the country. Tourism is still one of the main foreign exchange earners, but an increasing number of young Nepalese are seeking work outside the country, particularly in the Arabian Gulf. Despite the political uncertainty, tourists are still made to feel very welcome in the country.",

There are at least 26 major ethnic groups, with the majority of these living in the middle hills. In general, the people in the southern zones are Hindu followers while those from the high Himalayan valleys are Buddhist. However, there is no clear traditional divide in the major valley of Kathmandu, and many thousands of villagers ‘escaped’ from the effects of the Maoist insurgency to the safety of Kathmandu.",

Evidence of the Hindu faith in the Annapurnas manifests itself mainly through the festivals and celebrations of the people, rather than in an abundance of elaborate temples; it is as much a way of life as a religion. A very definite attitude of fatalism is conveyed to the visitor meandering along the populated trails. The monsoon often brings the destruction of a hillside or village by a giant mudslide, for example; these are seen traditionally not so much as resulting from the uncontrollable actions of nature but from the vengeance of the gods. Your own bad actions might be the cause of such misfortune.",

The trinity of Hindu gods are Brahma, the god of creation; Shiva, the god of destruction; and Vishnu, the god of preservation. They manifest in many forms, both male and female. Brahma is rarely seen – his work is done. Shiva is the god of destruction but has special powers for regeneration. Shiva can manifest as Mahadev the supreme lord, or as dancing Nataraj, representing the rhythm of the cosmos. As Pashupati he is the Lord of Beasts. Bhairab is Shiva in his most destructive form, black and angry. In his white form he is so terrible that he must be hidden from view, daring only to be seen once a year during the Indra Jatra festival.

                    "Naturally it is hard for trekkers to really know what is going on behind the scenes; the Nepalese are masters at appealing to the sympathetic nature of visitors to the country.",
                    "Tourism is one way in which the culture and livelihoods of the upland people can be sustained in the long term. The major trekking trails have experienced the growth of trekking tourism since the 1960s and the effects have generally been positive. The difficulty is finding the right balance, by improving local living conditions without destroying the existing environment and culture. It is not a unique problem to Nepal, as anyone who has visited other popular mountain destinations – even Chamonix or Zermatt – will have observed. As visitors we have our own views about development but ultimately it is the local people and the different tourism agencies that decide on the future of their region.",

The most luxurious bus is currently the Greenline service: US$25 including a great lunch at the Riverside Springs Resort about halfway to Pokhara. Other slightly less comfortable (but generally reliable) tourist buses depart around 7am from Kantipath near Thamel. ‘Local’ buses, which are even cheaper, leave from the Gongabu bus depot, northwest of the city, but are only recommended for those wishing to rub shoulders (and more) with the locals and their animals all day. The taxi fare to the bus depot is normally more than the bus ticket, so there is little to recommend this option. Local buses often stop in Mugling, an infamous, scruffy village 110km west of Kathmandu – eating lunch here has its risks. In days gone by, dishes of ‘hepatitis and rice’ were served up.",

The road descends through Naubise then soon follows the Trisuli River, passing through Charaudi, Malekhu and Majhimtar. Buses continue past the Manakamana cable car station for the temple shrine, and on to Mugling. Rafting parties can be observed on the Trisuli. From Mugling the road follows the Marsyangdi River through Ambo Khaireni, the turn-off for Gorkha town. At km135 is Dumre, where Annapurna Circuit trekkers need to wake up and change buses for Besisahar. Otherwise it’s on to Pokhara and, with luck, views of Himalchuli, Lamjung, Annapurna II and IV, along with Machhapuchhre; all are simply dazzling in the afternoon light. From Pokhara at sunset this astonishing panorama is truly heavensent – a vision that guests have marvelled at since Annapurna was ‘discovered’."

French alpinists Maurice Herzog, Louis Lachenal, Lionel Terray, Gaston Rebuffat and others were granted access to Nepal in the spring of 1950. Despite having ambitions to summit the higher peak of Dhaulagiri, they settled for Annapurna I. Much of the arduous adventure was spent finding access routes to the mountain and its lower ramparts. Herzog’s party succeeded in summiting Annapurna I on 3 June, making it the highest peak over 8000m attained, but the cost of the expedition on his and Lachenal’s frostbitten fingers and toes are the abiding memory for readers of his book.",

The early climbers were backed by vast entourages of porters, cooks and crews to carry their tons of equipment. In the 1960s ex-Gurkha officer Jimmy Roberts decided that the local portering traditions of the country, which allowed goods to ‘reach all those parts that were hard to reach’, could be adapted for trekking.",

Entering or exiting the country at the remoter crossing points and from Tibet may be subject to change, with the unpredictable political difficulties in some of these districts.",
                    "Applying in your home country is one option, although it will cost more. Be sure to apply well ahead of the time of travel, in case there are any holidays at the embassy related to the festival periods in Nepal. Many people obtain visas on arrival; at the present time this is the simplest option. The maximum length of stay in Nepal is five months in one calendar year (although the fifth month can sometimes be hard to obtain).",

Changes to the fees, the period of the visa, re-entry rules, and probably new rules we can only guess at seem to be introduced quite frequently. It’s also important to note that obtaining a visa in Kathmandu for India at short notice takes at least a week and most likely more time to procure. There is a new online, pre-arranged visa system which may still be a little confusing.",

Visas are normally issued on paper only for the duration of the stated itinerary, with extensions not possible. Allow for a few days in Kathmandu and make the application well ahead of your arrival in Nepal. Arranging the visa in Nepal must be through a Nepalese agent. Independent travellers can still visit Tibet by taking the ‘budget tour’ on offer through Kathmandu travel agents."

Its aims were to regulate activities within the zone to promote conservation in tandem with community development. The project began work on developing more ecologically sound ways of improving the environment. One major aim was to reduce the destruction of the forests caused by traditional wood-burning cooking; other schemes sought to improve health and hygiene levels, as well as improving basic infrastructure. Bridges, schools, health posts, safe drinking water depots, kerosene dumps and regulation of trekkers have all brought significant benefits to locals and visitors alike.

The permit should have seven days written on it, but the fixed entry and exit dates might reflect the six nights. (Fortunately the checkpost in Koto is much more in tune with reality and automatically allowed us the correct seven-night period, and they also let one trekker in a day earlier than their permit stated. This means you do not need to be bamboozled into paying for another week, unless you plan some extra days for acclimatisation or additional walks from Phu or Nar; crossing the Kang La will not need an extra week.) It’s very unfortunate that extra days cannot be added to this permit, as for Mustang.

Information on the internet is often not up-to-date, so you will need to check in Kathmandu or Pokhara. Even as this guide was going to press, there was talk of changing the rules to require all independent trekkers to take a guide or porter. Further talks continue on this issue, but as yet no law has been passed. Such schemes (usually instigated by the big trekking outfits) have been imposed in the past, but subsequently abandoned with equal speed. Previous schemes actually harmed many small or fledgling local tourist operatives, porters and guides – particularly all those outside the Kathmandu valley. The reason cited for the latest changes is security – mainly because some individuals who trekked alone and off the main trails sadly came to grief. How these new regulations will affect trekking in Nepal is not clear. Information about the independent TIMs cards is also subject to change.",

                    "A trek anywhere in the Annapurna range is best undertaken in either autumn or spring. The autumn period, usually the most stable, is the optimum period for trekking in Nepal and will be the busiest time on the trails. Traditionally early October (after the monsoon) heralded the beginning of this season, but in recent years unsettled weather has prevailed. This has given rise to unseasonable rain, heavy cloud and delays for those flying to Jomsom. After mid-October the weather is usually better, with clearer skies and magical views. The harvest is underway, carpeting the hillsides with fabulous colours. November is often the clearest month, with crisp and clear days likely well into December. December is much colder at higher altitude, but trails are quieter. The stable conditions expected in autumn can occasionally be disrupted – about once every five years – when a storm blows in from the Bay of Bengal, wreaking havoc with heavy snow in the mountains.",
                    "Trekking through the winter is perfectly possible, but heading to high altitude during January and early February might mean encountering more cloud, snow and bitterly cold temperatures; minus 20°C has been recorded in Manang. Trekking into the Annapurna Sanctuary then can bring the risk of avalanche, so check locally with the lodges before proceeding up the Modi Khola. Crossing the Thorong La on the Circuit is also risky – heavy snow makes this dangerous, with a risk of avalanche even before the pass is reached.",
                    "The spring trekking season runs from late February to early May. The weather is generally stable, although clouds are likely to cover the mountains more often, and it will be hotter and quite muggy in the lower valleys. Haze is another factor for those who want their mountains crisp and clear for photography. Trekkers interested in flowering plants always favour the spring, when the rhododendrons and magnolia are spectacular. Wind tends to be a factor at this time of year, particularly closer to the Tibetan plateau, north of Manang or Muktinath.",
                    "Trekking at the height of summer, July and August, is not recommended and is totally frustrating for those hoping to see mountain vistas. Cloud, rain and snow can be expected at any time from mid-June to mid-September. The monsoon also brings landslides, leeches and flooding – so forget it, or keep to the lowest foothills around Pokhara."

Trekking trails link the villages and are surprisingly busy; local porters, people off to markets, children scurrying about, dogs, monkeys, cows and trekkers all share these routes.",
                    "For many this is the preferred option, providing maximum security for visitors. The tour operator removes many of the difficulties and discomforts associated with other ways of organising a trek. Visas and permits can be easily procured, transport does not have to be considered and all day-to-day logistics such as accommodation, food and carriage of baggage will be taken care of. Most trips will be fully inclusive, with few added extras. Clients can relax and admire the scenery around the Annapurnas in as much comfort as possible. Group treks utilise both lodge accommodation and tents; take your pick.",
                    "Note that there are some disadvantages to commercial group trekking. Large groups with the support of a Nepali crew have more impact on the local environment. Sometimes clients have to wait at camp for the gear to arrive, although lodges will be well stocked with drinks and refreshments. A major disadvantage is that there is less flexibility on a pre-organised itinerary. You may also be hiking with fellow trekkers who have underestimated the challenges and may not be in the best of spirits. In general, however, most hikers enjoy the conviviality of like-minded fellow walkers.",
                    "One other unnecessary danger is the possible effect of ‘peer pressure’ within the group. At its worst this can overrule common sense, with some members ignoring symptoms of altitude sickness in the unacknowledged race to compete. Do not fall into this lethal trap.",

This is the wake-up call and means ‘get up now and pack your bags’. During breakfast, tents will be dismantled and the porter loads organised. Lodge trekkers can luxuriate in a warm dining area. Poor old campers will have to take the weather as it comes. With breakfast over and the loads packed, it’s off on the trail.",
                    "The morning walks tend to be a little longer to get the best of the morning’s clarity. Three to four hours is an average hiking period before lunch, including the odd tea stop along the way. Those on a lodge-based trek will find lunch ‘fooding’ easily on the main routes. Campers can slouch along until the kitchen boys and the cook come racing by to get ahead of the group to prepare lunch. It might be pancakes, bread or chips, tinned meat, fruit and other tasty goodies – probably a wider selection than available to the lodgers.",
                    "Afternoon walks are around three hours, although some days are inevitably longer because of the terrain. Campers should watch the kitchen boys and not get ahead of them. Afternoon tea and biscuits are served for campers (and group) lodgers on arrival at the night’s halt. Now is the time to read, rest or explore the locality. Dinner comes piping hot a little after sunset and may be a three-course delight. And that’s the day done for campers, bar crawling into that sleeping bag. Lodge guests can utilise the light, enjoying a beer or sampling the often dubiously produced local brews. (Be warned that so doing can adversely affect your health!) Take care with alcohol at altitude. It may be best to avoid it altogether.",

                    "Some of the following will also apply to small private groups and to independent trekkers hiring local staff. Normally the trek is led by a Nepalese guide who speaks good English and has done the trip many times before. Under him will be the most important member of the crew (not counting the cook): the Sirdar. His function (which can also be as leader/guide in a small group) is to organise all the porters, cooks and accompanying sherpas. With as many as 50 staff for a big camping group on a long trek, he certainly is a busy man. The cook naturally is in the spotlight; he will have several kitchen boys with him who will race ahead of the group to prepare lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. They carry all the cooking gear and often sing along the way.",
                    "In addition, there will be several sherpas. Some – although not all – may be from the Sherpa ethnic group who live in the Everest region. The term ‘sherpa’ in this context refers to the job of guiding the group, with one at the front and one bringing up the rear of the party. Big groups often have other sherpas floating between the front and rear guard. They also put up the dining tent and tents for the campers. Then there are the porters, as many as 30–40 for a large camping group. In such cases there will also be a Naiki (head porter), who takes some of the responsibilities from the Sirdar, organising and distributing the loads. The Naiki is often seen in the mornings adding items to a lighter load, causing some amusement and embarrassing the culprit who has offloaded a heavy bag on to a colleague in the hope of an easier day.",
                    "When booking a trek, be sure to check if all the food and meals are included. In recent years there has been a tendency for some companies to allow members on lodge treks to order and pay for all their own meals. This has happened because of the ever-rising costs in the mountains and because not including food appears to give a competitive edge in terms of the price of the trek.

                    "For those with more time, or who do not want to be locked into the group ethos, this is a good option, offering a great deal of freedom. Participants will be able to design and follow their own itinerary, according to their preferred length of trip and other special interests.",
                    "Organising a trip through an agent in the UK or Nepal for a couple or a small group is not necessarily more expensive than a group departure. Booking directly in Kathmandu is cheaper, but there is an increased risk because you will not be covered by any company liability if things go wrong. Be sure to have adequate insurance cover for helicopter rescue. These days there are a number of excellent local agents in Kathmandu who are very experienced in dealing with trekkers approaching them directly.",
                    "Contacting a local operator in Nepal is normally straightforward, although they might be unable to answer immediately at times because of regular, scheduled power cuts (known as load shedding). If you choose to arrange the trip with a Kathmandu agent, you can finalise the trip and pay the operators directly, but remember that if an internal flight is involved – to Jomsom for example – the agent might ask for some advance payment to cover that.",

                    "This style is very popular with those able to carry their own equipment and seeking a closer, more intimate rapport with the local people. It’s also a cheaper way to trek in Nepal and ensures that your cash goes straight to the local people. Anyone willing to carry their own gear, with some experience of hill walking, can easily arrange a lodge-based trek on the main routes around the Annapurnas. If you have already been to Nepal or other developing countries you will have the added advantage of knowing roughly what to expect.",
                    "Many other trekkers in the Annapurna region hire a local porter/guide through a reputable agency, paying a wage that also covers all of their living expenses. If you hire a porter, make sure you check and provide all the necessary clothing and equipment for high altitude. In the past porters have died on high passes due to lack of proper equipment. Porters should also be insured – this should already be done if you hire a porter/guide through an agency. Hiring porters off the street and hotel areas is not necessarily a good idea these days, unless it comes through reliable recommendations.",

                    "Being independent means you could have a long lie-in and make all those group people envious, but more likely you will want to be on the trail as early as possible. In the lodges you may be unlucky and find yourself at a disadvantage to the groups, who will often be served first. After breakfast the day is much the same as for those in groups, except that you can dictate your own pace, itinerary and lunch spots, so there are some positives against the negative of the heavy pack on your shoulders. Living off the lodges generally means a simple diet, but does that really matter? The lodges can supply all you really need in the way of sustenance.

In the past, camping throughout the Annapurnas was the best option, but today lodges are the more popular choice. Lodges en route are relatively basic, but dormitory-style rooms are rapidly being replaced by small but perfectly adequate twin-bedded rooms. Some rooms have en suite toilets and almost-warm showers. Beds tend to be hard, and dividing walls allow for a certain amount of communal interaction. Mattresses are getting thicker each year, so carrying a thermarest is not really necessary except on rare occasions (and for some homestays). There are now a few deluxe resort-style lodges in the Ghorepani/Ghandruk area, which are effectively ‘normal hotels’ with comfortable bedding, carpets and excellent dining areas.",

Most homestays are basic, with outside toilets and primitive washing facilities – much as the first trekkers found. Through local hydroelectric schemes electricity has now found its way to many rural areas, so lack of comfort is not quite on the scale it used to be. Mattresses may be thick or thin! Meals are provided by the household, using wholesome local produce. Don’t expect much other than nourishingdal bhat(lentils and rice) for dinner, but you could be surprised!",

Hot showers in lodges are generally provided by solar systems, but as with many aspects of trekking, utilising scarce resources (wood or kerosene) means conflict with conservation. Camping group trekkers will be given a bowl of hot water at some point during the day, normally mornings, and often now on arrival at camp as well.",

Those on fully inclusive group or independently organised treks with full services can expect filling breakfasts, including porridge/cereal, bread/toast with eggs, as well as hot drinks. Lunch is often a substantial affair, with tinned meat, noodles, chips, cooked bread and something sweet to round off. At night the lodges are able to provide two-or three-course dinners: soup, noodles/pasta/rice/potatoes as well as a dessert of fruit and so on. Plentiful amounts of hot water/drinks are available on arrival and at all meal times to ensure dehydration is kept at bay, especially at higher altitudes. The further you get from civilisation, the less choice there is, but this far into the trek anything tastes good!",

Across the city new shopping malls are opening, with familiar food brands and every possible item necessary for comfort. Pokhara Lakeside also has a good range of smaller supermarkets now. You might want to take some of your own supplies if venturing into remoter areas. Muesli tastes good even with water; instant soups and tinned fish are a good standby. Everyone should take chocolate, energy bars and snacks to relieve the eventual monotony of lodge food.

Kathmandu is at 1317m, so no effects of altitude will be felt there, but head straight up to Jomsom and Manang and you will feel light-headed for a couple of hours. The real risks start at heights above 3400m (11,000ft), especially if you climb quickly. In general, altitude problems in the Annapurna region are confined to the zone above Manang or Kagbeni on the Annapurna Circuit trek, and Machhapuchhre Base Camp in the Sanctuary. Anyone heading for Mardi Himal along the ridges from Pokhara is probably at the greatest risk of suffering the effects of altitude, due to the rapid ascent. Those conquering Poon Hill will rarely feel any symptoms. Be very careful heading to Nar-Phu; leaving the Nar Valley for Manang presents all the hazards of altitude on the Kang La. And those heading for a trekking peak such as Chulu, Pisang, Tharpu Chuli (Tent Peak), Singu Chuli (Fluted Peak) or the Dhaulagiri Icefall will obviously be well aware of the effects of altitude.",
                    "Learn as much as you can about the subject before you go, and check out the medicines on offer to aid acclimatisation (see below). The main symptoms of altitude are headaches, nausea, tiredness, lack of appetite and, later, disorientation. These in themselves are not a reason to stop the trek, but are good indicators of problems that may be overcome by resting when necessary. It is often difficult to sleep. Breathing patterns may be erratic (Cheyne-Stokes breathing) and the heart might thump a bit disconcertingly; however, these are not unusual reactions. It is also a danger to over-exert on arrival at any destination, thinking you have no symptoms; these often only begin to appear after an hour or more.",
                    "It is particularly important to walk very slowly, especially when climbing even a small hill. At all times, avoid any hurried walking. Be sure to admit any problems (if only to yourself at first), and don’t be pressured by your trekking peers.Altitude sickness can kill.If you experience any serious effects before any high pass, consider returning downhill immediately. Carrying on with mild symptoms, perhaps just a slight headache, is acceptable so long as it does not get worse or persist all day and night. The night at Phedi before the Thorong La will determine how well you are acclimatised, although few will sleep well here. Virtually all will feel the effects of altitude above 5000m; some may well feel nauseous and extremely lethargic. This is fairly normal, but symptoms will improve on the descent, so don’t worry unduly.",
                    "Continuing to ascend with any persistent symptoms can lead to the serious risk of pulmonary or cerebral oedema or even death. There are deaths each year in the Himalayas and Nepal, despite all the warnings. Sometimes complications from altitude sickness can strike very quickly.Descend immediately, whatever the time of day or night.",
                    "So what else can you do to ward off the effects of altitude? Many trekkers start a course of Diamox (Acetazolamide), a diuretic which thins the blood, makes you urinate more and is generally considered to be of some benefit, although it can have the disturbing side effect of pins and needles in the fingers. Another option is to try coca; not the smoking variety, but a version of the substance used by natives of Peru and Bolivia. Coca is available as homeopathic tablets that some trekkers (including the authors) swear by. It can be difficult to locate these in the UK, but French pharmacies stock them, should you be limbering up in the Alps before your trip. Also recommended by some are ginkgo biloba tablets, which appear to work for reasons not yet defined. It is suggested that these can be taken twice a day for five days before arrival and one tablet a day during the trek, but consult your GP before embarking on a course, as the tablets can affect the blood count and are not suitable for everyone.",
                    "A Gamow bag is a large plastic bag into which a person suffering from serious altitude sickness can be cocooned under higher air pressure to mimic a lower altitude for a limited period. Mountaineers have used oxygen cylinders for years at altitude. These are not generally required on the Annapurna Circuit or lower treks, but in exceptional emergencies may be available at the healthpost in Manang.",

                    "All mountain walking presents hazards, but with prior awareness and concentration on trek these can be minimised. In Nepal the biggest danger comes from the high altitude, severe cold and bitter winds. Be sure to keep well wrapped up first thing in the morning and make sure you are carrying enough warm clothing for the whole day. Group trekkers will not be carrying all their baggage – just a daysack – and it will not be accessible during the day. In the deep canyons the sun sets very early in the afternoon and temperatures plummet. Take particular care on the rough and rocky trails; bear in mind that the next hospital is hundreds of miles away. Remember that you may not be thinking as clearly as normal at these altitudes; don’t take unnecessary chances, such as leaping carelessly across rivers or boulders.",
                    "Dehydration is another factor easily overlooked; you may not necessarily feel thirsty in these conditions. Drink frequently, and remember that tea and coffee are both diuretics. Electrolyte powders added to clean water can be of some use. Taking note of the colour of your urine is one good way to keep these problems in check; if it is too yellow, you are not drinking enough. Breathing through a scarf at higher altitudes helps to retain some of the fluid that would otherwise be lost as moisture via the exhaled breath, and also acts as protection against dust and icy winds.",
                    "Other less obvious dangers in Nepal are unruly dogs. Normally these dogs are docile and easily controlled by their proud owners, but things may be very different during a night-time visit to the toilet. Better still, don’t plan on going out at all at night, but improvise some sort of suitable receptacle. Choose a large-necked plastic container, and make sure the lid seal is good! A Shewee’ might fit the need.",
                    "Don’t be put off by all the above advice; just take care and enjoy the trek! Forewarned is forearmed. Trekkers and climbers cannot tame the weather, but there are some modern sages who can predict, with surprising accuracy, the patterns to come."

                    "Who is the ‘Sorcerer of the Clouds’? How does he weave his magical spell over the mountain ranges of the world?",
                    "For a mountaineer there is only one aim, to get to the top, but is their destiny at the mercy of the clouds? Early climbers on Everest in the 1920s argued incessantly about the ethics of using oxygen on the mountain. Was it sporting, or was it cheating? Today aids come in all forms – better equipment, knowledge and communications technology – but few climbers would openly suggest that any modern device is anything other than an additional source of help in achieving their goal. Debate rages on about the purity and morality of climbing, but is it not safety and humanity that are paramount?",
                    "An almost mystical new aid is that of the ‘router’. They are dedicated meteorologists, using real time, space age satellite imagery, superb communications and scientific skills to advise climbers about the prevailing weather conditions on any mountain anywhere in the world. They can make incredibly accurate predictions about wind speed and direction, cloud conditions and imminent changes in the weather. The Sorcerer of the Clouds can wave his wand to enhance the safety and the chances of success on any peak, but it is the gods who will cast the final spell.",
                    "One such sorcerer has ‘climbed’ the Himalayas through this technology without setting foot on any slope: Yan Giezendanner has done this from his wheelchair in Chamonix. His extraordinary story is told in the book,Le Routeur des Cimes, originally published in French by Editions Guérin, now translated into English asThe Sorcerer of the Clouds, published by Pilgrims and translated by Siân.",
                    "Don’t become a ‘basket’ case",
                    "At one time it could be said that there was virtually no crime in Nepal, but those days have long gone. However, it is still an amazingly safe country for foreigners to visit. You are very unlikely to encounter any problems in Kathmandu, even well into the night (though night owls might want to avoid grungy dogs in the early hours). Embassies and tourism departments do not recommend trekking completely alone and suggest you register your trip at your embassy or online. Isolated incidents and attacks have occurred in the hills, and theft from tents has increased. Trekkers should not trek alone on the forested trails of the Ghorepani, Tadapani and Ghandruk areas or in any other lonely zones. Individuals are recommended to team up with other trekkers at the lodges when planning to walk through isolated areas. Take sensible precautions, as you should almost anywhere these days.",
                    "On trail look out for yaks – these mountain animals are usually calm but meeting on a narrow trail or meeting a yak that is agitated would be a problem.",
                    "Other obvious hazards come from ill health, altitude, cold weather and the occasional avalanche or flood; but careless actions like tripping up while walking along trying to take a photo, or looking at a text message, can also lead to trouble. Evacuation by helicopter is not guaranteed: the terrain might be too high, there could be prolonged bad weather or, conceivably, there might be no serviceable helicopter in Kathmandu. Trekkers are still carried out in baskets on porters’ backs in an emergency, and might have to endure a few days of this rollercoaster ride. It’s best not to fall over!",

                    "Some of the equipment listed below represents a considerable financial outlay, particularly if it’s for a one-off trek. Many of the commercial trekking companies now provide some necessary basic gear such as sleeping bags, but others do not. These days it’s perfectly feasible to turn up in Kathmandu and hire all the equipment for a fraction of the cost. Even buying new gear can cost substantially less than it would at home. Most will want to bring tried and tested boots, but it is actually possible to purchase boots in the shops of Thamel with confidence and at very low prices (the authors have been buying boots in Kathmandu for a number of years). Boots can cost as little as US$40, although spending a little more is a good idea. Try Mingma at the Everest Equipment shop (near the Kathmandu Guest House) for excellent locally made down jackets and sleeping bags, as well as anything else you might need.",

Nepal never went through the development of land-based phones across the country, although they did become a novelty for a few years along the trails, with roughly one phone booth every four days’ trekking distance. Nowadays it’s common to see local people (including monks) all over the country talking and texting on mobile phones. Some may think that this section should be placed under ‘Hazards and security’, such is the impact mobiles have had! That said, don’t expect connection everywhere; mobile network coverage is sporadic. Two of the main operators are N-Cell and Nepal Telecom.",

                    "You might be shocked by the ‘load shedding’ power cuts experienced in Kathmandu, but in the rural areas the situation is much better. For some years hydroelectric schemes have been installed across much of the Annapurna region. Almost every village on the Circuit, Sanctuary and Ghorepani area has sufficient power for lighting at least. However, you will not find power on the camping trek of Annapurna–Dhaulagiri in the remote northern stages, and a few distant villages do not yet have electricity. The visually and culturally electrifying region of Nar-Phu is also currently completely unelectrified, despite a broken-down hydroelectric scheme in Nar, which will hopefully be repaired and functioning again by the time this book is published.",
                    "Kathmandu (1317m) is the most frequently used gateway to the Annapurna region. The magical city and its welcoming people make it a wonderful home away from home. Numerous excellent hotels and guesthouses cater for all tastes; a myriad of restaurants, cafés and bakeries provide varied and sustaining food. Trekkers should spend a few extra days exploring the city and its environs for, despite some modernisation, the valley holds some enchanting surprises.",
                    "Kathmandu is still a crossroads of the Himalayas: a trading centre and melting pot of migrating peoples and religious ideas. The cities of Kathmandu, Patan, Bhaktapur and the surrounding valley host perhaps the greatest concentration of temples, shrines and idols anywhere in the world. The religious mingling of Hinduism, Buddhism, Tantra, Vajrayana, Tibetan Buddhism, Bon and Shamanism is a mystery in itself. Legends abound; folktales and myths are the lifeblood of Nepalese festivals and everyday life. It is still fair to say that idols (but not ‘idle’ hippies – long may they be remembered as the eccentric pioneers of Nepal’s tourist industry) almost outnumber people, and temples outnumber tourists."

A chaotic cacophony of spluttering sounds erupts; pedestrians compete for space with bicycles, cycle rickshaws, motorbikes, motor rickshaws, taxis and minibuses in the vibrant, colourful streets and alleys. Yet quiet corners, where little has changed for centuries, remain, with a few holy cows lingering beside a grotesque gargoyle or serene idol. Hidden in the intricate maze of narrow alleys, potters spin their wheels by hand and antique Singer sewing machines perform miracles. Buddhists spin their prayer wheels, sending incantations skywards for peace. The rumour mill is in full swing; Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens are always in the café around the corner. People gather in front of a Ganesh idol to offer their devotions for a prosperous day. Trekkers scurry about, getting a T-shirt embroidered with their latest trekking route, or ‘Yak Yak Yak’! And the dogs lie dormant, gaining strength for another night of action on the streets…",

InKathmanduthe central market area of Asan is a kaleidoscope of colour. Close by in Jan Bahal, seek out the glittering courtyard temple of the enigmatic Seto (White) Machhendranath. Buried within the lanes and alleys of the old city are Itum Bahal, a typical Newari courtyard-style housing complex, Sano (Little) Swayambhunath and the temple of Nara Devi.",
                    "Patan, across the river, is a city of artisans and quaint, quiet lanes. Deep in the old quarter are the Kwa Bahal (Golden Temple) and the temple of Rato (Red) Machhendranath, as well as many other exquisite temples and shrines.",
                    "Bhaktapur, 11km east of Kathmandu, is the least modernised city of the valley. Its Durbar Square is intriguing, but don’t miss its other squares: Nyatapola, with a five-tiered temple, and Dattatreya Square, a majestic scene of intricately carved wooden windows and fine brick structures. In the quiet streets of Bhaktapur, time stands still. Its medieval atmosphere is a living relic of a forgotten era.",
                    "Not far away are some famous pilgrimage centres. On a hill to the west is the Monkey Temple (Swayambhunath), a picturesque Buddhist stupa surrounded by shrines and temples. At Boudhanath to the east, Tibetans and other Buddhist devotees circle the great stupa, seeking peace. Beside the holy Bagmati River is the Pashupatinath temple complex, where Hindus offer their devotions and where they are cremated before passage into the next life.",
                    "South of Patan are Bungamati (Red Machhendranath temple and quaint houses), Kokhana (Shekali Mai temple), Pharping (Buddhist monasteries and Guru Rinpoche cave), Shesh Narayan (a temple devoted to Vishnu) and Dakshinkali (an often-gory temple, where pilgrims offer live sacrifices to the bloodthirsty goddess Kali).",

Others include the Courtyard, Garuda, Marsyangdi, Mandap, Manang, Potala Guest House, Utse, Vaisali and the Norbu Lingka. For a taste of Tibet, try the Hotel Tibet in Lazimpat. Nearby is the newly rebuilt Hotel Ambassador. Those seeking greater luxury can lodge at the Hotel Malla on the edge of Thamel, while further out are the Hotel Vajra, the Hotel Shankar (a former Rana palace) and the palatial Yak & Yeti or Annapurna hotels.

The main tourist area is Lakeside, where hotels, restaurants and shops abound. There are a few ‘must-dos’ in the Pokhara area, such as climbing to the Peace Pagoda, or discovering the lake by boat. Many visitors head to Sarangkot, a spectacular vantage point, to watch the sunrise or sunset on the Annapurna ranges. Pokhara’s number one attraction, the Himalayas, remain untainted, brooding and standing sentinel over the valley.",

Printed maps often give different figures, so a ‘guestimate’ compromise has been used. Altitude variations within the trekking descriptions attempt to indicate the rough changes along the walking trail. This is a seemingly impossible task, given the lack of accuracy on the maps.",
                    "The trekking stages described do not always correlate with day-to-day itineraries. Itineraries reflect the typical and most popular trek route and duration. With time and energy, it’s perfectly possible to combine the treks described. Appendix A gives suggestions for trek itineraries based on tradition and personal experience, together with a rough grade of difficulty.",
                    "Something of a revelation in the area now is finding some trails marked by painted stripes. Red and white is used for main trails, with blue and white for optional, harder, side treks. In the past locals often used the odd signposts as firewood. There has been resistance to having signs, as it’s thought they reduce the need for local guides. ACAP has been responsible for the new markers, but they are not seen at regular intervals and are at times erratically located. Don’t despair if you haven’t seen a marker for a while – keep a sharp lookout, as they adorn all sorts of locations. It’s a bit like playing ‘I spy’!",
                    "Route markers at Kalopani (Trek 1)",
                    "A source of much debate is the accuracy of daily trekking times for each stage given in guidebooks, and no doubt this edition will be no different. Everyone has their own ‘normal’ pace, but these vary enormously. The authors have attempted to give an average time for the walk; extra time has been added to cover a few photo stops, pausing to tie up a bootlace, and for those quick visits into the vegetation. In any case, a trek in the Himalayas is supposed to be an enriching experience and a holiday, with time to observe the surroundings. A trek is not, for most hikers, a competition to see who can climb the Thorong La faster than a Sherpa.",
                    "Lodges along the trails have deliberately not been named. When it comes to picking where to stay there is very little to choose between them; mostly it comes down to where you happen to be by late afternoon and which place catches your eye. Lodges also have a tendency to change names or be reincarnated with better facilities.",

                    "It may seem unnecessary to remark on this topic, since a road obviously makes access much easier. However, nothing in Nepal is quite as it seems.",
                    "While researching the road access changes for the Cicerone Everest guide in October 2010, the authors were surprised to find that ‘new roads’ built under the auspices of the UN Food program, ostensibly bringing supplies to rural areas to alleviate food poverty, did not serve the purpose. In that guidebook trekkers are advised to stick to the original trails where possible to avoid the ghastly, bone-wrenching, ‘shake-rattle-n-roll’ tracks and muddy quagmires – also nominally called the ‘new roads.’",
                    "The normal effect of a new road in Nepal is to create noise, pollution and inevitably the destruction of the once-pristine environment. Very few of these new roads are sealed, which means rough rides, delays due to avalanches, floods and bridge washouts; journey times are never predictable. Bear this in mind when planning your itinerary, particularly on the Annapurna Circuit. Some of those who were lucky to visit Nepal earlier endlessly lament the coming of roads, but from a Nepalese point of view this is progress; no more humping heavy loads along a slippery trail, crossing precarious log bridges or being eaten alive by leeches. According to local people, who are mostly in favour, the Jomsom road has significantly reduced prices of food goods (sugar Rs200/kg down to Rs80). The apple producers are also pleased, because they no longer have to throw away rotting apples; they can be transported quickly to the markets down the valley and in Pokhara.",
                    "What gives us, as temporary visitors, the right to bemoan the loss of these trekking routes (except that some ‘bypassed’ lodge owners also feel the same way)? Why should the local people not have the advantages we all take for granted, such as easy access to medical care and luxury goods such as washing machines? We have to take the treks as we find them now. Nepal is there to change you, and not for you to change it.",
                    "Because the definition of a road is so variable in Nepal, the authors have devised the following terms to describe the roads encountered – none of which, as may be expected, gives a smooth, seamless ride. As the locals continue to point out, ‘This is Nepal…’ – the standard answer for anything not appearing as it might be elsewhere!",

Along the Marsyangdi Valley, the road, such as it is, is already usable for most periods to Manang. However, this road is subject to landslides, making planning tricky. Most trekkers ignore the road and plan to walk to Manang, at least from Dharapani or Chame. If the road is cut by a landslide, vehicles are normally found on either side of the offending zone, meaning some delay but not days (unless the slide is abnormal in scale). Some trekkers do take jeeps and rickety buses directly to Manang, but it’s unwise for most visitors because of the rapid gain in altitude. Better to plan on starting from Chame. That said, it’s not out of the question to head for Manang as quickly as possible, paying due attention to altitude issues, and spend the time exploring all the fabulous routes above the village. New red-and-white trail markers have been painted and upgraded recently by Andrees de Ruiter and Prem Rai, while ACAP has opened some new trails.",
                    "Unless you want to meet every trekker on the route during your trip, it is unwise to do this circuit in the other (clockwise) direction. The lie of the land – especially the steepness and altitude gain on the ascent to the Thorong La from Muktinath – makes that choice unattractive and dangerous.",
                    "The highway from Kathmandu toDumrehas improved immensely and, once clear of Kathmandu, the 135km journey is generally comfortable. Most buses make it to Dumre in around 5hrs. Unless you are on the direct daily bus to Besisahar, the choice onwards from Dumre is limited to local buses or private transport to get to the furthest roadhead. You can definitely reach Bhulbhule, and getting as far as Chame by jeep is now possible. Beyond this will depend on the latest construction and any avalanche or monsoon damage. The 42km road from Dumre to Besisahar is mainly sealed, but even this (1½hrs+) section is not all smooth going.",
                    "The better lodgings inBesisaharare at the north end of the long, straggling bazaar. Try the Mount Kailash Hotel. (Recently a chapatti here cost Rs80, a small pot of tea Rs100 and a main course – dal bhat – Rs350.) There is an information office, ACAP entry and TIMS checkpost here.",
                    "If you want a jeep, you need to arrange it in Besisahar, because they do not normally pick up trekkers in Bhulbhule. A bombed-out bus runs between Besisahar and Bhulbhule when sufficient customers have waited patiently, costing foreigners around Rs250. The uncomfortable ride on the dirt road takes 1hr, passing through Khudi.",
                    "Note that an alternative option can be taken from Khudi to Syange, but this has not been checked by the authors. From Khudi a little-used trail heads up quite steeply from the village. With views of Himalchuli and Ngadi Chuli, it contours along the west side of the Marsyangdi through the settlements of Dhangai, Ghosing, Sirung, Kalagiring, Sildhunga, Athkhey, Chhapagaon and Mipra before dropping into Syange. Heading off on this path means hiking through settlements that have had little contact with trekkers, so be prepared with some extra food and take a guide. There are only basic teahouse-style lodges in Ghosing and Sirung. This may well become a new trail option to avoid the new dam construction near Ngadi.",
                    "Following the drama of the Marsyangdi River as it cuts its way undaunted through the Himalayas, the first few days are exhilarating. Trekkers exchange the humid, lush farming lowlands for the defiant deepness of the gorges that dissect the sheer-walled Himalayan peaks, constantly climbing through the ever-narrowing canyon. The transition to the arid upland of the Tibetan plateau around Manang is astonishing and geologically fascinating. Equally absorbing is the cultural change from Hindu-dominated settlements to the manifestations of the Buddhist peoples.",
                    "FromBhulbhulethere are two options. Walk or hitch a lift on one of the jeeps (hard negotiation may be required: priced per seat, or hire the whole jeep) along the west bank of the Marsyangdi via Arkhale to Syange, Jagat and Chamje, or follow the old trail through Ngadi to the quaint Brahmin hill village of Bahundanda and on to Ghermuphant. A new dirt track is being ‘engineered’ from Arkhale to Bahundanda.",
                    "This option follows the original trail and is on the east side of the valley. Until the new dam project at Ngadi it was completely untroubled by the jeep road. As construction continues apace, expect disruption to the trail. Bhulbule had some good lodges and a checkpost. The trail headed relatively benignly up to the village ofNgadi(930m). En route up the Marsyangdi are views of Ngadi Chuli (7870m), previously known as Peak 29.",
                    "From Ngadi the trail crosses the Ngadi Khola, then climbs rather tiringly up toLampata, through wooded areas and terraces dotted with farmhouses. As work continues on the ‘new road’ to Bahundanda, there could be some disruption to the trail, so keep an eye out for the right direction wherever the road is intersected. Being the first real big hill, this hike can seem rather long, butBahundanda(1310m) is welcoming. ‘Bahun’ means Brahmins, who predominate in the village and often paint their houses blue. Brahmins are a priestly caste, but many are also poor. Danda means hill or ridge, thus Bahundanda – hill of Brahmins.",
                    "From Bahundanda the path drops on a stepped trail, where care is needed. Continuing more gently, it contours through farms where rice and millet are grown on terraced hillsides.",
                    "Milletis a popular crop, providing grain as well as the ingredients of a popular intoxicating drink,thukpa.",
                    "AfterKanigaonandGhermuphant, it’s not far to the bridge across the Marsyangdi toSyange(1100m).",
                    "Above the Marsyangdi River near Syange",
                    "The jeep road from Bhulbhule climbs gradually up and then down toArkhale, with spectacular views of Himalchuli ahead. It’s a rather hot walk. After Arkhale the ‘road’ heads up and down past a bridge to the east bank, and up to Ram Bazaar (2¼hrs’ walk from Arkhale). There are two lodges in Ram Bazaar and, if you are walking, expect another hour toSyange.",
                    "Cut through Syange and then join the jeep road that you have to follow via the settlement of Shree Chour. The ‘wide track’ to Jagat makes a series of big zigzags up before contouring down to the village ofJagat(1314m).The cluster of buildings at Jagat has 10 or so good lodges (mattress thickness 10cm, so quite deluxe).",
                    "From Jagat, the route heads north on the west side of the Marsyangdi, following the jeep track. Magnificent waterfalls tumble on each side of the ever-narrowing canyon. In less than 30mins there is a red/white marker on the left indicating the ’Old trail to Chamje and Manang’. Following this takes you up beside a pretty waterfall, then right at a junction signed to Manang.",
                    "The path climbs on for 15–20mins to an abandoned lodge. At last it becomes flat, leading on to a functioning lodge with a stunning waterfall in view across the valley. This detour on the path takes less than 1hr toChamje(1433m), with the last part gently down. If you are in a hurry, ignore this side trail, as the road is much quicker.",
                    "This stage is characterised by the ever-steeper cliffs that hem in the Marsyangdi River.",
                    "Originally the river was crossed on nerve-tinglinglog bridgesthat threatened to collapse into the foaming fury at any moment. Those precarious obstacles have now been replaced by new suspension bridges.",
                    "En route you will start to see many mule caravans carrying goods.",
                    "At the end of Chamje village, where the new road heads left, watch for a sign ’Way to Tal’. Go down to your right on a very steep path, which is loose underfoot. Cross the Marsyangdi on a suspension bridge then puff your way steeply up steps and a rough trail past primitive teahouses, shady trees and scruffy bamboo groves. The narrow path, sheer canyon walls and the astonishing road construction high above on the opposite bank are enough to keep you enthralled. The gradient of the Marsyangdi River is very steep here, as you embark on the long zigzagging pull up to Tal – this is the very heart of the Himalayan range, dissected by the river over millions of years.",
                    "The trail climbs towards Tal",
                    "Tal(1700m) is located at the top of this staircase in the Himalayas, a flat area hemmed in by sublimely sheer cliffs. The sky is virtually shut out all day except at lunchtime, when Tal trekkers can bask in the warmth – a little taste of paradise. Tibetans have settled here and run many of the lodges. Tal marks the start of the Buddhist zone, with prayer flags, a mani wall and chortens. It has a small Nyingma-pa monastery, with the iconic triplets – Chenresig, Sakyamuni and Guru Rinpoche – as the main idols. The ‘road’ on the west bank looks horrendous, with sections blasted from sheer 800m cliffs – anyone fancy a rollercoaster ride?",
                    "From Tal, the way soon follows a narrow path below the cliffs; watch out for the mule trains here, and always keep on the safe side (inside). There is a waterfall, junction and sign in about 30mins. For Manang, climb the steep steps over the bluff, then drop under an overhang, keeping on the main trail. The route crosses the Marsyangdi on a suspension bridge then climbs steeply on a sandy, loose trail for 10mins.Ignore the old trail on the east side that climbs higher and contours around below cliffs and broken areas – it might be reopened if, or when, the road becomes too busy.",
                    "The Marsyangdi gorge en route from Tal to Karte",
                    "Follow the wide track steadily below a waterfall (where a cold shower is free) and continue up toKortewith a rustic yet acceptable lodge. The old trail (and possible future trail) is seen across the valley, cutting below more cliffs. Follow the wide track to a suspension bridge and cross toKartewith good ‘lodgings’, including the now famous Dorchester, on the corner by the signposts.Anyone wanting to stay at the Dorchester should telephone 97460 14142 for reservations!",
                    "ACAP has marked anew optionfrom Karte to the right, via Nache village to Dona (Duna) Lake. It’s a five-day, high and wild camping trip to the second-largest lake on the circuit. The lake at 4700m is below Ngadi Chuli, with views of the Thulagi Glacier. On the way, the herder’s trail passes through pine forest, where red panda, deer, musk deer and pheasants might be encountered.",
                    "Continuing on the trail, it’s pleasant but narrow. The ‘road’ on the west side can now be followed, but since the mules use it, you might find the path much better!",
                    "Cross into lower Dharapani then walk for another 10mins up to the checkpost (Tal to Dharapani takes 2–3hrs). The wide track road is complete throughDharapani(1960m), with its good selection of lodges, ever eager to encourage you to rest and recuperate. (A small pot of tea costs Rs300 in a Dharapani café.)",
                    "Dharapani marks a change in the trekking route direction, towards the west into cooler climes.",
                    "This region isGyasumdo, meaning the ‘meeting of three highways’. Typically you will see corn, barley, buckwheat and potatoes being cultivated. On the right is the canyon that leads to Bimthang and the high pass of Larkya La bordering Tibet, on the Manaslu Trek.",
                    "The walk now climbs steadily. To avoid the wide track from Dharapani, turn right at the sign for Larke in the middle of the village. Cross the suspension bridge and climb up into Thonje village, past a chorten and kani archway to the main junction of Thonje. Bimthang is right and Bagarchhap is left, although it is not marked. Thonje has a small monastery with an impressive central icon, the Sakyamuni Buddha holding his bowl.",
                    "From Thonje follow the north bank to a solid bridge (35mins) on a trail that ascends above scruffy bamboo and thinning forest. This high north bank trail passes through isolated villages and, when fully restored, might become a new trail to lower Danakyu, where there is a bridge. Until then you need to cross the Marsyangdi on the high bridge and climb steeply up through pines to rejoin the wide track. A newly renovated, long disused trail now continues further along this bank and might offer an alternative to following the road around Danakyu but means missing those nice lodges. It’s steadily up all the way toBagarchhap(2164m, 1hr). Bagarchhap was tragically devastated by a mudflow in November 1995. Most of the houses were washed away, killing local people and trekkers; as a consequence it is rather a sombre place, although the monastery above the settlement is worth a few minutes detour.",
                    "Soon after Bagarchhap there is a signed junction. Head left for Manang. The climb is steady on a muddy track to some isolated lodges (‘even lower’ Danakyu) and on to lower Danakyu, with some good lodges (about 2hrs from Dharapani.) The main area of upperDanakyu(2300m) is 15mins uphill, with good views east of Manaslu North and the ramparts of Phungi Himal. Danakyu has a ‘safe water’ station. The cost of nourishment has risen with the altitude.Lodge mattress thickness is still 10cm here, so you should sleep well after a solar hot shower.",
                    "The best trail heads across the large suspension bridge of ‘even lower’ Danakyu, 20mins from Bagarchhap. Then, after another bridge, follow the path beside a stream. It zigzags up to a white chorten and climbs steeply on up. The village has been totally unaffected by passing hordes. Houses are traditional stone, mud and wood, people are curious and life continues at a slower pace. Allow 2hrs for this trip.",
                    "There is a major change in the route from Danakyu – some maps currently show two routes, the old and the new, as ‘roads’. Today the main trail goes to ‘upper’ Timang, high on a shelf above the river.",
                    "The trail to Timang",
                    "From upper Danakyu, follow the ‘road’ where it hairpins left. The path up the riverbed is now subject to dangerous landslides. Higher up, if the river is flowing too fast, you’ll need to drop to a wooden bridge. A big zigzagging climb commences, with a panoramic view over Danakyu. The route heads up steadily to a small bridge and the pipe of a hydro plant, then climbs through rhododendrons to a woodcutter settlement and steeply up on to the wide track ‘road’. Take the trail off to the right, just after the bend, for Timang.Timang(2720m) has seven lodges and welcoming sustenance. It’s roughly a 300–350m climb from Danakyu to Timang, taking up to 2hrs. The jagged walls of Manaslu and Ngadi Chuli shimmer on the eastern skyline, while to the south is the daunting Namun La.",
                    "Continue into mixed forest of pine, fir, oak, maple, walnut and rhododendron on the wide track, with glorious unabated views east. The trail is almost level now. The first houses of Thanchok/Lata Marang are reached about 40mins from Timang. The trail then descends to a flat meadow, beside a long mani wall and down a slippery path to a bridge. Inevitably it’s steeply up next, on a loose trail around those gnawing rockslides, to a meadow and the main part of Thanchok village. It might be easier to follow the new road sometimes around here. Thanchok is one of the few very traditional old settlements, with ‘fooding’ and simple lodges as well as more views of Himalchuli, Ngadi Chuli and the Thulagi Glacier above Dona Lake.",
                    "The wide track ahead traverses below shady cliffs and forest to Koto (Kuparkodo), taking about 45mins.Koto(2600m) has a small monastery and superb views of Annapurna II. At the exit of Koto is a checkpost beside the Nar-Phu trail turn-off.For more details, seeTrek 6 Nar-Phudescribed in Restricted Area Treks.",
                    "From Koto the way is delightful en route to Trichyngalta (three lodges). Ahead it’s not more than 10–15mins to the kani and prayer wheels of Naya (new)Chame(2670m), the regional administrative headquarters. (Luckily the kani arch is too low for buses.) Sunsets are spectacular here, as Manaslu North (7157m), Manaslu (8160m) and Phungi Himal (6540m) soar skywards, glowing a fiery red in the dying twilight.",
                    "Manaslu at sunset, seen from Chame",
                    "Chame has well-stocked shops, a profusion of lodges and a safe water station. Dal bhat costs Rs400–450 so food prices go up about 10 per cent every 300m (at this rate dal bhat should cost Rs4500 on the Thorong La!) A large pot of lemon and ginger tea in Chame might cost Rs2000 in the Shangri La! Inflation – even in paradise.",
                    "Towering unbelievably far above the whole valley is the slumbering giant of Annapurna II, with its black, rocky ramparts and seas of ice and snow.",
                    "After ‘passing out’ of Chame through the colourful kani/stupa, the route reachesTalekhu. Soon the wide track enters the pine forest of the old trail. It’s easy to be intoxicated by the sweet scent of pines, the silence disturbed only by the trance-inducing flow of the bubbling turquoise river. The idyllic mood is rudely awakened soon by a couple of disruptive, exposed landslip zones before the breeze into Bhratang (2850m).Bhratang(2–2½hrs from Chame) is the only place for a food break before Dhukure Pokhari, a long haul ahead. The settlement used to have extensive cherry blossom orchards, but now it is all-but-abandoned with just one teahouse lodge – the Raju.",
                    "Beyond Bhratang the valley narrows, the sheer walls forcing the river to concentrate its flows. The old path was well engineered, etched cunningly into the cliffs. The new road follows this and could be followed more easily than the old trail, which diverts to the west bank. Following the trail just beyond Bhratang, go down left, following a sign ‘Way to Manang’ into the trees. The trail descends and follows the riverbank below. In 10mins you cross the Marsyangdi on a cantilever bridge. Shortly the path climbs and contours before a very steep, slippery but short descent, which needs care. A wooden cantilever bridge is crossed in 5mins back to the east side, before climbing up exceedingly steeply on another very loose path cutting through a soft conglomerate band. Watch out for mule trains here; keep against the rock walls. Shortly rejoin the wide track road (1hr from Bhratang).",
                    "The bridge over the Marsyangdi below Paungda Danda",
                    "The incredible, smooth sweep of the vast rock slab of Paungda Danda appears on the right, gouged out by ice, admirably displaying the forces of nature. The rocky trail climbs to cross a bridge, through more loose bands of rock and then pleasant pine glades interspersed with silver birch. A somewhat relentless but gradual climb follows, which always seems tiring – the first consequences of altitude are kicking in here.",
                    "The trail levels off and soon there are some red/white markers where you rejoin the wide track that descends slightly to the much-expanded wayside stop ofDhukure Pokhari(3185m, 2–2½hrs from Bhratang). After the tea stop, follow the trail signed to lower Pisang (or take the trail right for upper Pisang). It’s a relaxing walk and not far to lowerPisangvillage (3200m), where more comfortable new lodges are being built with unbridled optimism. Clinging to the hillside below Pisang Peak, upper Pisang (3300m) is a stunning, medieval sight, the stuff of dreams. It has a picturesque monastery, a few lodges and lots of stone houses, with fluttering prayer poles and evocative chortens.",

                    "Known asNyesyang, this region is in the Himalayan rainshadow on the geographic fringes of the Tibetan plateau. A dry desert-like landscape unfolds, with far fewer trees.",
                    "There is a choice of trails – the easier low main route via Humde/Hongde, or the more demanding, drama-filled high route via the villages of Ghyaru and Ngawal. If you are feeling the effects of altitude, stay low and enjoy the meadows; otherwise, give the rugged high trail a go. Both routes are very rewarding.",
                    "Leaving Pisang through the village, head down across a small cantilever bridge and climb briefly up to an impressive chorten. Following the wide track/road, it’s a long, steady, seemingly never-ending climb to the Ngoro Danda col (3440m). The view compensates by opening a window on the tranquil Humde Valley framed by the Chulu peaks. From dramatic ochre-coloured cliffs you advance, gently gaining altitude, toHumde/Hongde (3400m), an ideal lunch spot (2½–3hrs).Flights have virtually ended at Humde airstrip, so it doesn’t offer a fast escape route, especially since the dirt road opened. The new road is never far from that used by trekkers and is often shared.",
                    "After the checkpost, the route snakes into a zone of strangely contorted turrets and ghostly looking canyon walls, eroded into phantom-like shapes. After crossing the Sabje Khola, you amble though dry meadows. Soaring to the heavens are the sun-bathed, silhouetted outlines of Annapurna II, IV, III and Gangapurna. The Manang Mountaineering School is on the left, guarded by the snowbound col between Annapurna IV and Annapurna III.",

                    "Across the Marsyangdi is the settlement ofMungji(3482m). An ACAP sign suggests the Ice Lake (4600m) to the right takes 3½hrs. The much-promoted Milarepa Cave (4000m) is up to the left and may take 2½hrs. Mungji seems to have more goats than people, as well as a nice stupa and an acceptable lodge. It’s a short stroll on toBraka(3500m).",
                    "This is definitely a tough walk, but for those well acclimatised the panoramic vistas, the culture and the unique villages are the main features of the day. The altitude is showing its teeth in earnest by now, making it hard to predict the walking time. Start early, climb slowly and methodically – there is no gain in rushing on, because the views are sensational all day. This magical, airy balcony of the gods offers fantastic photo opportunities – especially when conditions are crystal clear.",

Cross this and head left, looking out for the signpost to Ghyaru and Ngawal. Up past the chortens and across a flat meadow, there is a wide path through sparse trees which climbs to a substantial stone wall and gateway in 20mins. Continue through the gateway and on up. (Ignore a small path on the right to some chortens.) The trail skirts a green tarn on the right and meets the trail from upper Pisang (see below for the onward route).",

Once the climb (350m) is achieved in about 1½hrs, the path levels as it contours around the barren hillside, peppered with berberis and rough grasses. Goats, sheep, dzopkios and yaks inhabit these high pastures, with the occasional marmot or blue sheep disturbing the grazers.Ghyaru(3670m) has typical flat-roofed, stone and wood houses and is one starting point for climbers of Chulu East.

The monastery is astounding, both for its location clinging to the crags among pinnacles and its aesthetic beauty. A visit to the monastery should not be missed, but trekkers will need to be diligent and extremely patient to find the man with the key. The path is on the left side of the meadow, up steep steps."

                    "Braka Gompa",
                    "The Kagyu-pa monastery houses images of most of the sect’s major icons: Milarepa, Gampopa, Nilopa, Marpa and Tilopa. When Snellgrove visited in 1956, he noted images of the Buddhas of past, present and future, Dipankar, Sakyamuni and Maitreya. His keen observations also picked out Vajradhara, Prajnaparamita, a red Dakini, Tara and Avalokiteshvara. Mahakala and Palden Lhamo, the ferocious-looking protectors, are in the Gonkhang chamber, but most such chapels are never open to visitors at all. The protective deity of Braka is Mentsi, who was revered by the clans of Braka after they fled reprisals from Manang following a suspicious murder. Today three clans remain in Braka, but three clans left for the Narsing Chu Valley to seek refuge. Braka also has a bakery at the Hotel New Yak, with Internet and good food.",
                    "High above Braka is the Ice Lake (4600m). It makes a good acclimatisation excursion, although it’s a tough, dehydrating climb. The route is indicated by blue/white markings.",
                    "From the bakery in Braka, head for the white chorten across the soggy meadows and pass the mani wall. Beyond the big tree, cross the small wooden bridge and proceed into the narrow alley. Follow the blue/white markers up and go right up to a sign. This trail can also be accessed from the monastery by contouring east and into the back of the village. At the junction, the Ice Lake path is left and then on up. The path is rather exposed and eroded now as it traverses the hillside, demanding extra care. Only the goats seem to be doing any maintenance on the side trails. Views of the monastery, Braka village, Tilicho and the Grand Barrier are distractingly sensational. The relentless, unforgiving ascent is long – it’s not absolutely vital to reach the lakes, as the views are captivating all the way up.",
                    "To visit Milarepa’s Cave, expect an 800m climb. This cave was a ‘penthouse’ of the Tibetan hermit poet and magician Milarepa. According to local folklore, he was deep in meditation when a doe-eyed deer dropped in. A local hunter, Khiya Gonpo Dorje, followed the deer into the cave, to be confronted by Milarepa in soporific meditation. Such was his surprise that he immediately became a disciple there and then. According to one legend, Milarepa lived on stinging nettles that turned his body green.",
                    "To get here from Braka, cross the river and head northwest, picking up the trail near some eroded pillars. Apparently the actual cave is located in a gully but the authors have not made this trip.",
                    "On the trail to Manang",
                    "From Braka to Manang is a 30min hike, passing chortens to the welcome kani. A steep ascent brings you to the lodge area of the village.Manang(3540m), with a permanent population of around 200, is the focal point of the whole region and a village that until recently lived in a time warp. Its ancient stone and wood houses are substantial and a pleasing sight. The lodges are cosy and intimate, but when Herzog’s party came here in 1950, they could hardly procure any food at all. Although it’s very easy to while away the days in Manang, hopping from one teahouse to another, it’s perhaps not the best use of time. There are many options for the recommended acclimatisation ‘day off’, which sometimes turn out to be more exhausting than normal days on trek!",
                    "Those needing more rupees can normally restock at the Hotel Yeti with Mastercard/Visa in high season. Others with cash can get poor exchange rates from willing locals; a bank may appear one day soon. The Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) clinic is manned by foreign doctors in season (open 9am–12pm and 1.30–5.00pm), but by the end of November it could be closed. At 3pm daily there is an informative talk about altitude sickness and its dire consequences. A visit to the ACAP tourist centre is worthwhile to see its displays, but it’s not always manned.",
                    "Anyone contemplating hiring a pony and guide for the Thorong La should check out the options in Manang, where prices can be fixed for the trip in advance. A pony from here to the top of the pass for three days may cost around Rs15,000 (about US$150). Waiting until you get to Phedi ‘bottomside’ does not mean you will get a cheaper deal – quite the contrary, if demand is high. Prices are not negotiable higher up, where the pony sharks lurk, awaiting their prey – the flagging trekker. Hiring a pony is a very pleasant and relatively comfortable option, and enables hours of panoramic viewing.",
                    "Even if you spent the previous night(s) in Braka, it’s worth spending an extra day around Manang, with so many good options on offer. Enjoy a day trip to Khangsar, hike up a rough track to a wonderful viewpoint, visit the Gangapurna Glacier lake – or even sleep all day. On the northeast side of Manang is the hermit retreat of Praken (Tsamkhang), a half-day monastery excursion.",
                    "The suggested itinerary takes in the Bodzo Gompa, the Kama Dorje Gompa and Praken Gompa. From the Manang entry kani cross the riverbed towards the obvious path directly below the orange-painted old fort high above on the crags. The trail zigzags steeply up on a dusty path. TheBodzo Gompa(30mins), locally called Vujeck Gompa, was reputedly founded by Guru Rinpoche. The main chamber may be closed, but the courtyard is accessible. The external paintings are exquisite, with a prominent Wheel of Life, the four guarding Lokapalas, the ferocious protectors, Tamdrin and Channa Dorje, and the Harmonious Friends. Take a minute to study the hillside from here towards the white stupa on the ridge to the northwest.",
                    "On leaving the gompa go right, descending steeply. It’s very loose underfoot, but only 10mins down to the riverbed. Head for the second (of five, left to right) water mill and cross the stream. The Kama Dorje Cholong Karki Gompa is on the hillside above. There is no obvious path at the moment, so pick the vague trail on the left of the complex around a fence that climbs steeply. Is the monastery ever open? There is no good path from here and the original route, north of the monastery, is very dangerous through strangely eroded outcrops. Head up from the monastery fence; the gleaming white stupa high above is not always visible on this climb. Head towards it as best you can, following poorly defined goat trails.",
                    "Beside the white stupa is a signboard for the Kama Dorje Choeko Ling retreat. Two trails lead from here to Praken, seen high above on the sheer cliffs. The two trails meet, then pass walled meadows. Ahead the path goes right towards the five white chortens seen earlier on the skyline.",
                    "This track slogs steeply up through an eroded ‘organ pipe’ area. Continue on, passing the gurgling underground water storage facility. There are absolutely fabulous Himalayan views yet again. Continue up to a sign welcoming you to Praken Gompa; it’s still a hard steep slog up to the monastery (3900m). A chorten guards the holy retreat, built into the overhanging cliff. Care is needed on the descent back to the white stupa. From here go down right on a narrow path to a large gnarled tree where two routes drop into Manang; go left for lodges in Manang and right for old Manang.Praken Gompais roughly a 2hr climb directly above Manang.",
                    "Northeast of the old part of Manang, near a gully and a few chortens, is a roughly defined trail that climbs ever higher. It’s pretty steep, but eventually reaches some sharp needle-like outcrops. From this airy vantage point, the panoramic view encapsulates the entire Annapurna barrier, except for the ever-elusive Annapurna I. The descent on loose stones and grit requires care.",
                    "The Turquoise Lake (Gangapurna Lake) below Gangapurna is a popular choice for the day; the creaking, tumbling glacier is tremendous. It takes 30–40mins to reach the lake and, for a different view, head further up to the viewpoint of Papu Chong, high above the lake (at least 3hrs for the round trip).",
                    "The Khangsar Valley and the trail to Tilicho Lake",
                    "Although quite close to Manang, this fabulous village with its ancient houses and traditional culture sees few trekkers. Staying overnight is easy, and standards are rising; and, being on the Tilicho Lake route, it is bound to see an increase in takers.",
                    "Initially go through old Manang along the Thorong La route, then turn left at the big chorten, passing the prayer wheels with a sign for Tilicho near the Post Office. The path snakes down from the village and in 10–15mins crosses the new road. Continue to the kani, where you see a sign for Tilicho painted on the rock – go right – this is also the correct path for Khangsar. Ahead is the old trail to Khangsar marked on all the maps, but definitely closed due to landslides.",
                    "Do not attempt theold trail; the authors investigated this, but had to turn back after 3hrs of effort. At the sign for Tilicho, go ahead to the chortens, then down to cross the bridge. The narrow path descends to a meadow before climbing steeply to a plateau area with great views of Pisang Peak – a good enough reason to come this far. Ahead, however, is a dangerous landslide zone that has closed the route from there on.",
                    "Trek up steeply from the Tilicho sign and in 10mins you come to a wide track. Contour belowTenkivillage, hiking gently around the hillside bluffs to a suspension bridge. Cross and go steeply up on a narrow path with some overhangs. The Thorong Khola (Jharsang Khola) seems to appear as if by magic from the enclosed canyon. At the top of the rise is a kharka with distant views of Ngadi Chuli and Himalchuli. The trail passes electricity pylons, then drops down to a wide track, then a path around the hillside. It’s a steady walk up to a lockable gateway/kani (apparently keeping animals out of crop areas).Khangsar(3734m), where little has changed over the centuries, is steeply up and offers a rare view of Kang Guru peak.",
                    "Khangsar has four good lodges; a cup of tea costs Rs40 and dal bhat Rs400. Mattress grading is not so sparkling thus far. On the way back to Manang, you can leave the wide track near Tenki and head left instead of down. Be sure to drop three terrace levels as you go and follow the path down a stony streambed before joining the main trail from Gunsang into Manang at the mani wall.",
                    "Pisang and Kang Guru peaks from Khangsar",
                    "Note that taking the link trail from Khangsar to Yak Kharka further north on the Annapurna Circuit direct is risky, especially on your own. The route is tough, goes very high and is not marked; the goats have not maintained the trail here. Once across the ridge, the route drops to the Thorong Khola and climbs out to the Khenjang Khola teahouse. It is much safer, easier and quicker to take the main route from Manang via Tenki."

                    "This high, lake-filled saddle offers a little-used route to Jomsom that avoids the Thorong La, but the risk of avalanche and frequently bitter weather dampen most notions of taking it for the recreational trekker. Crossing to Jomsom this way is really the domain of well-equipped mountaineers. However, it is not such an ordeal for trekkers to reach the lake from Khangsar. Check that the lodges and trail options en route are open.",
                    "During the season, while good weather continues, two lodges are open at Tilicho Base Camp, making an attempt on Tilicho Lake feasible for well-acclimatised trekkers. (One very fit trekker did it all in one day from Khangsar, but ‘normal’ trekkers should plan three, or better four, extra days for a return trip from Manang.) Stay in Khangsar to acclimatise and then head to Tilicho Base Camp, passing Thare Gompa. The high trail to Tilicho can be closed by dangerous landslides. The spectacular lower trail is hard, loose underfoot, unstable and potentially dangerous, especially crossing sands where oddly designed pinnacles stand like sentinels. Allow 6–9hrs for this walk.",
                    "From Tilicho Base Camp it’s an arduously steep climb, much on loose moraine, to a chorten (5000m) and on to the viewpoint. Tilicho Lake (4920m/16,140ft) is a fabulous spectacle, with its deep blue waters, tumbling glaciers and the great fluted icy wall of the glistening Grand Barrier. Return to Base Camp and the next day head back to Khangsar and/or Manang.",
                    "With the ‘lazy’ days of Manang behind, attention begins to focus on the crowning pass ahead. This is a high, wild and rugged place, where herders once eked out a meagre living and today’s lodge owners do rather better (and some pony men better still!) Unless you have experienced high altitude before, nothing can prepare you for the Thorong La. You’ll gasp for breath, wondering why anyone wants to climb a Himalayan mountain – get buffeted by cruel, demonic winds, endure a knee-jerking, endless descent – yet after all that, you’ll probably find you can’t wait to do it all over again on some other remote pass.",
                    "At one time Yak Kharka and Churi Lattar (sometimes written Ledar) were isolated stone shelters, almost unnoticed by trekkers heading on to Phedi from Manang. Today, when altitude is treated with much more respect, these settlements have blossomed into lodging spots en route to the foot of the pass.",
                    "From Manang the trail begins a dusty 30mins’ climb toTenki(Tengi), with its new stupa. As the path continues up, a superb vista opens westwards as the gigantic, fluted wall of Tilicho Peak looms above the Khangsar Valley. New red/white markers guide you around Tenki (3642m), going left around to a tree. From Tenki the trail climbs to Gunsang (2hrs from Manang.)Gunsang(3900m) has two good lodges, and staying here to acclimatise on this sunny shelf makes a lot of sense, with great views.",
                    "Continue climbing to the Khenjang Khola/Julu East teahouse (30–45mins), distracted by the great amphitheatre of Chulu Central and Chulu West. More red/white markings reassure before crossing a suspension bridge to another teahouse. The gradient is easier now, but tiring due to the altitude. It might take anything from 3½–4hrs to reach Yak Kharka, but do not rush.Yak Kharka(4018m), affectionately known as Yak Yak Yak Kharka, has a hydro plant and five or six lodges; unfortunately the sun deserts it rather early in the afternoon, making it a cold place. Some 20mins uphill beyond Yak Kharka is the grand-looking Himalaya Hotel in Upper Yak Yak Yak Kharka!",
                    "Climb slowly up to the next side valley ravine, noting the stunted juniper as a distraction. It’s an energy-sapping amble, but luckily a new suspension bridge over a deep ravine minimises the effort required to reachChuri Lattar(4200m). Chulu West is sensational from here at sunset. There is a safe water station, but currently no ‘proper’ toilets (or electricity – just like Kathmandu!). It’s a bit of a shock to have to go to bed so early; make the most of the late afternoon sunshine.",
                    "Chulu West, seen from Churi Lattar",
                    "Leisurely it may be today, but the toll of high altitude begins to bite as Thorong Phedi is reached. There’s no great panic in the morning to be on the trail – the longer this hike takes, the better will be the chances of adjusting to the increasing altitude. However, during high season, the availability of bed space in Thorong Phedi becomes critical, so don’t linger too long or you may end up on the floor overnight.",
                    "From Churi Lattar it’s relatively gently but slowly up. There is a teashop and the odd red/white marker. Stop and look back, or you might miss yet another spectacular view of Annapurna III and Gangapurna – just another Himalayan sunrise! Continue up to a junction, 1hr or so from Churi Lattar. Go left here and look for the markers down to another junction.",
                    "At one time the‘new trail’was on the east side of the valley and climbed rather tiringly high. Seen to the right, it has luckily fallen into disrepair. The safer way to Phedi has now reverted back to the even older path, which was previously prone to avalanches or landslides and was positively lethal in snowy weather.",
                    "Go left at the junction, descending to the new suspension bridge. The other trail before the bridge looks easier, but it is eroded and, out of sight round the bend, has a snappy, steep climb out of the river from the very old lower bridge. The new way is marked and passes the new Buddha Kitchen coffee shop, a great spot for nourishment and contemplation (2hrs). The trail contours and climbs up to where the two paths join near another tea stop – the Deurali Teahouse – another much appreciated rejuvenating tea stop. The way traverses the hillside with some narrow sections, dipping down to a landslide zone with protective stone walls (to duck behind during stonefall.) Watch out for Himalayan thar around here, but stop walking before looking up. Ascend briefly up through another landslip area, where it is again narrow; ponies need to be surefooted here.",
                    "After another exposed section, it’s on across the final boulder area toThorong Phedi(4450m). This fortress-like enclosure is the old upper Phedi area, not the lower camping area used years ago. There is an efficient hydro plant and, with luck, you will see blue sheep here. The first lodge was opened in 1981 and the current ones are used almost all year round, since the owners stock up in winter for the spring season.The crags above Thorong Phedi invite some trekkers to scramble to a viewpoint, but be aware of the location; think twice about this apparently ‘must do’ option.",
                    "Encircling Thorong Phedi are dark, somewhat forbidding cliffs, crags and ridges. Phedi literally means ‘bottom of the pass’ in Nepalese; those who rush up too fast may feel it’s rock bottom.",
                    "With double-glazing and en suite toilets in one lodge and good food in another, staying at Phedi ‘bottomside’ can be relatively comfortable if you are well acclimatised. Sometimes the Internet is available; sometimes there is music. With mountain loads of anticipation, relatively crowded lodges and the altitude, it’s not going to be the best night’s sleep. You are likely to meet trekkers from all over the world, all gathered together in sight of the pass.",
                    "High Camp is roughly 250m further up, about 1hr on a steep and always exhausting zigzagging path. However, do not contemplate heading up there from Yak Kharka or Churi Lattar in one day. This adds greatly to the risk of altitude sickness. Staying at High Camp after a night in Phedi is a good idea for those with time or doubts about their acclimatisation.",
                    "Porters approaching Phedi",
                    "",
                    "It’s the big day, and the obsessional focus of the last few days. Everyone wants to get on with it, since crossing the pass removes the last major obstacle to making the full circuit. The weather always dominates conversation here: will there be snow, how cold is it, and what time is everyone else departing in the morning?",
                    "Waking up – if you’ve slept at all – is a relief. In the past it was deemed necessary to leave around 3am, but the wisdom now is to avoid the bitter cold of the night and leave just before dawn. Regardless of what was decided the night before, many trekkers do leave early, perhaps because of just wanting to get on the trail. Be sure to cover your nose with a scarf in order to minimise the loss of fluids as you climb, and never ascend at a rate that sets both lungs and heart racing. Those who climb slowly and methodically often get to the pass more quickly. There is an altitude gain of almost 1000m to be conquered, taking 3–6hrs. If snow is encountered higher up, the trek is more exhausting and potentially dangerous.If you are on horseback put on extra socks to keep your immobile feet warm and avoid frostbite.",
                    "Remember that altitude can kill.Do not trek alone over the pass. Don’t attempt to cross the pass in any storms, especially if there is snow. Getting stuck here is lethal, with arctic winds and poor visibility. Take adequate warm clothing, emergency snacks and plenty of water. Bad weather is the usual reason for tragedy. Turn back if you get a very severe thumping headache and start to become disorientated.",
                    "By torchlight – or in the first flush of dawn – most will be climbing relentlessly on this first section. The path zigzags up and up. After a while a rhythm sets in and, with each step, the realisation of the achievements ahead brings inspiration. Initially the route is right of the boulder scree and below the cliff on the right. The first hour is a seriously tiring climb to a narrow gully, where you might hear the snowcocks awaking. Once the sun comes up, the fantastic panoramas are your wake-up call as Annapurna III and Gangapurna welcome the first rays. Their icy ramparts rise like the great godly sentinels that Nepalese folklore has attributed to them. It’s easy to appreciate the beliefs of the local people about these peaks as homes of their feared and benign gods.",
                    "High Camp lodge (4800m) with 110 beds is a sort of deluxe mirage, but it’s good to top up on much-needed fluids here.From this cosy spot there is a narrow path to a somewhat exposed viewpoint – it passes the time if you overnight here.",
                    "Soon after dragging yourself away there is a short, exposed section with drops on the right; take great care, especially in snow. The peak of Yakwa Kang appears in view; the way is up, steeper and around a bend. A large sand conglomerate ridge is seen ahead and the trail climbs to a bridge. Be careful traversing the loose sandy ridge upwards. Soon go around the bend again.",
                    "The amphitheatre of peaks show off their finest – the captivating cirque of Purkung (6126m), Putrun Himal (6500m) and Genjiang (6111m) to the north and northeast, with tumbling glaciers in abundance. The great mass of the whole Chulu range appears to ever-greater fanfare on the eastern horizon. The path climbs to another warming teahouse about 1hr up from the last stop. It is highly recommended to drink more tea here. Porter services are on offer. The next section is a bit of a killer, so pony men hover around like vultures from here to the pass. Don’t be surprised to be quoted US$300 (to be paid in five rupee notes of course!) for a 30-minute gallop to the top. (Just think how much would you ask for, if you had to hang around up here to make a living?) The path climbs steeply now, through rough ground up and up towards the sky.",
                    "Climbing to the teahouse on the Thorong La trail",
                    "The final approach to the pass can be rather frustrating, as a number of false summits are encountered. Be sure not to speed up in anticipation of bagging the summit cairn, as these false demons are guaranteed to extract the last vestiges of energy. Continue to plod on, however slow the pace seems; keep a good rhythm and try to breathe with a diligence that constrains an over-extended heart – the pass is at hand and all the effort will soon be rewarded. There is a great mound of stones and a briefly joyful respite – downhill for a minute or two. With immense relief it is followed by the final pull to the prayer-flag-drapedThorong La(5416m). Don’t sit on the pass ‘topside’ too long, because the effects of altitude can creep up quickly, either here, or as you begin the long and tiring descent – the bitter, icy wind is ferocious and never abates.",
                    "It’s not a bad idea to take an expensive brew in the tiny teahouse at the pass – it’s a very long way down to the next at Champarbuk or Charbarbu (4300m). At Rs80 per cup, it’s a bargain. Two trails head down from the summit of the pass but soon meet. Then it is necessary to swing down towards the left side of the wide valley. Be sure to stop for a rest out of the wind and admire the wondrous panorama on display – the amazing changes in the landscapes across the Kali Gandaki Valley of Eastern Dolpo and Upper Mustang. The mood lightens as dramatically as the view offers its drama. Slightly to the northwest you can see four snowy peaks in a roughly symmetrical line, although they are not shown on any current Nepalese map. Roughly translated, they are named Rum, Dum, Tara and Rara. The distant peak behind them is rarely visible, save on the most sparklingly clear days – and, according to trekking folklore, has been climbed just once.",

                    "The descent to Muktinath (3–5hrs) begins in earnest immediately, as the trail snakes down moraines and ridges. The mountains in view are Dhampus Peak and Tukuche Peak, but before long Dhaulagiri will reveal itself in majestic glory. Be careful to watch your footing and stop occasionally to admire the views. Dropping constantly, the trail can be rough and loose in places, with some pole markers.",
                    "At a junction the route heads left on the wider trail steeply down to a meadow viewpoint just over 1hr from the pass. It is very steep down to a ruin and a cairn with panoramic views over Muktinath. Continue the relentless descent. Look for red/white markers to avoid the long loops of the disused and disconnected new road before reachingChamparbuk(at least 3½hrs down). A tea stop is obligatory here; your knees may be trembling. Continue down through the cafés to a new suspension bridge high over the ravine. The temple area ofMuktinath(3710m) is a welcome sight, then it’s down to the kani gate of Ranipauwa. Note the path for Jhong here on the right, marked by the familiar red/white marks. If you spy the quirky Hotel Bob Marley with the Rasta-rock café you might think you are still suffering from the altitude, but it’s real enough. Enjoy the spicy enchiladas!",
                    "The old street of Ranipauwa is rapidly changing, but it is jeep-free and there are still some old traditional structures such as the police checkpost building. The jeep depot is 5mins west of the main street. Jeeps to Jomsom for foreign tourists cost Rs700 per person and currently depart at approximately 9am and 4pm; it’s possible to hire a complete vehicle (or as ‘complete’ a vehicle as can be found in Nepal!). A number of new, large, characterless hotels have sprung up in Ranipauwa to cater for well-heeled Indian pilgrims. The Grand Shambala, though, has a more pleasing appearance and is a good place to stay. Four Tibetan monasteries are to be found in the vicinity, and there is a multi-activity trail-biking possibility down from Muktinath along the jeep tracks.",
                    "Hindu pilgrimage shrine at Muktinath",
                    "The pilgrimage centre of Muktinath hasshrinessacred to both Hindus and Buddhists. Many Hindu pilgrims come from India; some walk all the way. The Hindu temple is devoted to Vishnu, flanked by Lakshmi and Saraswati. Around the main shrine are 108 cow-headed waterspouts, the focus of the pilgrims. Scantily dressed holy men –sadhus– often congregate here. Buddhists are attracted to the sacred flame, hidden in the corner of the Dhola Mebar Gompa (also referred to by its Hindu name, Jwala Mai). It is a temple of fire – a natural gas jet and a spring that traditionally represent earth, fire and water, which is why this place is seen as a holy spot. The monastery of Sarwa (Marme Lhakhang) contains images of Avalokiteshvara, Sakyamuni and Guru Rinpoche, whose footprints are said in legends to be imprinted on a stone outside. There is also a Bon deity on site called Sengye Droma (lion), which is generally likened to the Hindu avatar of Vishnu, Narsingha. Seewww.muktinath.orgfor more background information.",
                    "Crossing to the west side of the Thorong La brings a spectular change in landscape, as the upland pastures of Manang give way to desert. Looking north towards Upper Mustang are barren vistas, snow-touched peaks, multi-coloured cliffs, strangely eroded crags and outcrops – an exotic, remote and once-forbidden destination. The trek down the Kali Gandaki canyon will blow your mind as much as the wind will bowl you over. There is history and culture aplenty, thankfully unaffected by that much-talked-about modern intrusion – the road."

                    "It’s a huge shame that the arrival of the road from Pokhara to Jomsom has been viewed so negatively by many trekkers. It is relatively easy to avoid and most visitors wouldn’t classify it as a road anyway. Only around 10–15 vehicles per day ply the routes, and the buses are some of the worst in the country, with very poor maintenance. It’s far better to trek out if you have the time, enjoying the exceptional scenery instead of suffering a bumpy and dangerous ride on the highway to hell. The only other alternative is to take a flight out of Jomsom to Pokhara, but these can be unreliable because of bad weather. Winter fog closes the airport in Pokhara in the early mornings, and by 10–11am the howling winds in the Kali Gandaki prevent any form of flight except for the Himalayan Griffon and other dramatic birds of prey.",

There are two main routes between Muktinath and Kagbeni. The traditional trail descends via Jharkot as the new jeep road keeps its distance. More exciting is the newly permitted trail that heads through monastic villages like Jhong, reminiscent of Upper Mustang, and on across arid desert landscapes to Kagbeni. The whole area is dotted with caves once used by hermits, sadhus and sages seeking contemplative meditation and austere conditions to find enlightenment.",

The village has retained its traditional ambience.Khingar(3200m) is the next settlement, with a few lodges.

Head up briefly and join a wide track; cross the river on the wide track and look out for the red/white marks. Continue around and left at the next junction. The trail goes up into the village ofChhyonkarunder trees. The Tantric monastery is at least 200 years old, but expect it to be closed (the key was probably lost years ago). The village houses are brightly painted. Follow the markers; go left at the monastery by the chortens and then down (1hr from Muktinath).",

Descend to the long suspension bridge and follow the wide track/road, contouring around the hillside to the superbly located village ofJhong(3600m, 2hrs).

Until the 18th century the monastery housed monks from all over the region, including Upper Mustang.

Now you need to keep left, down the rough, rocky trail into the glade, with a reassuring sign. In 10mins go right at more red/white marks and contour around the hillside to a suspension bridge over a deep, dark mysterious ravine, once home to troglodytes.

However, it is still possible to walk mostly on east side trails, since the road is invariably high above the valley. Jeeps to Jomsom cost Rs400+ plus a possible baggage fee. It’s only a short hike to Jomsom, so there is time to take a side trip to Lubra (Lupra) if you’re feeling fit.

Gongphu means ‘temple of the high cave’ and it has many wall paintings that show the life of the Bon. The main icons here are the Red Apse, Dungmar, Shangshung Meri and Sipai Gyalmo. The multi-armed and multi-headed deity is Kunzang Gyalwa Dupa. Down in the main settlement of Lubra by the river is the historic Yungdrung Phuntsholing Bon monastery that was initiated by Karu Drupwang Tendzin Richen from Western Tibet. It houses nine notable clay images, including four prominent ones: Tonpa Shenrap (the Buddha figure of the Bon), Nampar Gyelwa, Drupa Namkha and the Lubrakpa icon Trashi Gyaltsen.",

The main settlement of Lubra is across the long suspension bridge, along the riverbed and up to the left. It takes 3–4hrs from Muktinath to Lubra this way. The ancient Bon monastery of Yungdrung Phuntsholing is a must-see. Visiting the upper monastery is quite a haul up from here. See above for more details.

The jeep depot is on the north side near a new monastery. Follow the paved street and cross to the right at the wooden bridge. Bus tickets for Ghasa (Rs900), and maybe beyond to Tatopani and Pokhara, can be purchased here. The contraptions depart on a whim at around 9am or 4pm and possibly at noon in season. It’s claimed to be a 3hr ride to Ghasa. Buses are rumoured to depart for Beni at 7am and 8am if there is enough demand (which means probably not at all, since on the authors’ last visit the bus syndicates were making everyone change vehicles in Ghasa).",

He makes an amazingly evocative sight embracing his dark green consort – the lady of boundless space. Welse Ngampa sometimes stands on five animals: lion, elephant, horse, dragon and garuda. The other idol is the white image of Kunzang Gyalwa Dupa. In his right hands he holds a royal banner, a swastika and a wheel. In his left hands are the bow, arrow and noose.

In about 10mins you come to a traditional wooden ladder. Scramble up this and come on to the top of the meadows (view north here towards Chhairo and Marpha). Go right to a watermill and two more ladders. Use these to enter the village near a chorten and mani wall.Chimang(2750m) is a typical, small Thakali village, a ‘mini Marpha’, with narrow paved streets, beautifully clean stone houses and brown wooden doorways.",

Return this way or take the zigzag path back down. At the bottom a different way along the valley floor allows you to rejoin the main Tukuche trail that you abandoned at the river crossing sign. Cross the wide track and take the small path down to a log bridge, continuing down valley.",

Famed for its former prominence in the salt and wool trade with Tibet, it boasts four monasteries and many exquisite houses. Tukuche Guesthouse is a typical Thakali merchant’s trading house, with ground-level storage for goods and stables. The upper floors are the living areas and under-table coal buckets provide warmth and comfort in the superb restaurant. A museum housed in the old distillery, down by the riverbank, celebrates the time that the Japanese monk Ekai Kawaguchi spent here in 1899. There are also great apple pies at Sunil’s. Tukuche’s Nyingma-pa Qupar Gompa is 400 years old. Entry is from the east side upstairs; donations are gratefully accepted. The main idol is the ancient classic, 1000-armed Chenresig with 11 heads.

Larjung is a base for tackling the Dhaulagiri Icefall. The route used to cross the wide expanse of the Kali Gandaki, making it a long, arduous and stony section, especially if the wind was strong. You might want to stick to the main trail/road through Larjung; the new alternative trail offers solitude but is less interesting and little used.",
                    "Leave Tukuche at the far west end and turn right into the riverbed; cross an old bridge near the road bridge. This route keeps below the main road and takes shortcuts along the stony riverbed of the valley. Head roughly towards a lone house to join the road where the riverbank permits. Follow the main road that goes around the cliffs. After 1hr or so you come to the ‘conurbation’ of Kanti/Kobang and Larjung. A long new footbridge to Saru is under construction across the wide expanse of the Kali Gandaki here.Kobang(2560m) centre is a further 10mins. The Makila Khang Gompa is worth a look – it’s on the left past a watermill near the riverbank. The main idol is Guru Rinpoche. Note the fading old painting outside of a chain and a tiger – the vehicle of Guru Rinpoche.",

Look for a big rock with writing on and scramble up right. This path continues up to two Nepali pagoda-style temples. Cross the wide track and go up steep steps, passing a small gompa on the right. There are more steps up into forest, zigzagging for a while. At the top is a new lodge on the left, a chorten and the Thakali-style village sitting on this sunny shelf.",

Of the three images, Kunzang Gyalwa Dupa is on the left, Welse Ngampa is central, with Namse on the right. The Guru Sangbo cave linked to Guru Rinpoche is beyond the village. On the return route you can divert directly through Larjung to the lodge area by way of the narrow street off the main road.",
                    "Leaving Larjung, go west across the mudflats briefly to rejoin the road. The road undulates around the hillside to a wide valley with a stony riverbed. The road loops a long way to a bridge and around the west side of the valley, so it’s quicker to cross the riverbed area on log bridges.After the monsoon the river may be uncrossable, in which case you will have to follow the road.Be careful on these; some are narrow, others could roll.",
                    "Once back up on the road, walk around the spurs to the main trekkers’ suspension bridge over the Kali Gandaki – it squeezes through a narrow gorge here (1½–2hrs from Larjung). There is a sign on the other side indicating Sirkung to the left, but you should now go right for Kokhethanti. It’s another 10mins toKokhethanti(2560m), where there are a couple of lodges.",
                    "For the trail on the southeast bank of the Kali Gandaki, ask locals in Tukuche where to cross, as the log bridges move with the seasons. The route offers a full-on view of Dhaulagiri. You may need to retrace your steps northeast from Tukuche for 30mins to the bridge for Chokhopani (see above). In general, the way crosses alluvial fans and goes through forest relatively low down by the river. After a short climb around bluffs, the route drops to an isolated house and on to the village ofSaru. Another alluvial fan is crossed here, and to Sirkung the way is mostly just above or along the riverbed. The authors have not walked this section, which joins the main trail by the Kali Gandaki suspension bridge well before Kokhethanti. As yet there are no facilities on this trail, so be prepared with water and snacks. (The new footbridge from Saru may be open if you want to recross to the west bank.)",
                    "From Kokhethanti continue toDhampuon a good stone trail that has been used for decades. It’s best to keep above the river here on this pleasant contouring route, although during winter when water levels are low the route dips into the riverbed, saving a few minutes. Ahead is the crossing point of the Kali Gandaki, with a choice of two suspension bridges. (There is a trail from these bridges up through the forest to Titi Lake, but it’s a lonely prospect and best done with a guide.) Shortly after rejoining the road, you see a sign on a big rock; turn left for Ghasa or go straight ahead to Kalopani/Lete.",
                    "If you are considering a variant to the main route via (or side trip to) Titi Lake, be aware that, according to locals, you need a good 3hrs to climb up and then down to Kalopani/Lete. This makes it best tackled earlier in the day, particularly as the afternoon weather is often cloudy or windy. You might need to stop in Kokhethanti overnight. Views of Dhaulagiri in the mornings are reputedly ravishing. Lodges are being built along the route. Shortly after Kokhethanti you will see the trail, actually a jeep track toTitivillage and nearby lake. It’s about 45mins up to the village; ACAP has marked it in the usual red/white dashes. Konjo is a traditional village up here; it’s necessary to detour to find Taglung Gompa. The descent heads toChhoyothrough forest close to power lines. It’s a short walk from Chhoyo to the main trail at Kalopani across the Kali Gandaki.",
                    "Kalopani(2530m) is the only place on the whole Annapurna Circuit from where the elusive Annapurna I peak is visible; it’s mind-blowing at sunset. Little of the old village remains, but with good lodges, Kalopani makes a nice stopover (although it is noticeable that some mattresses are thinner on this side of the Thorong La). Some lodges close for winter around mid-December.Note that some old maps are wrong here, as the main road is always on the west side of the Kali Gandaki river.",
                    "Keeping warm and fed in Kalopani",
                    "Following the road is much quicker and the volume of traffic is still light, but taking the alternative marked trail is not to be missed. Currently there are no good facilities along the trail, except basic lodgings in Pairothapla and Kopchepani, so be aware of your timings and don’t get caught out in the bush.",
                    "Return to the big rock (see above) and take the new alternative Ghasa trail, now on the right. (There is also a shortcut to this new trail from the central part of Kalopani, on the east side, which joins the trail near a clearing with a single building nearby.) The way is serenely peaceful in the forest of blue pines with early morning birdsong – it’s an entrancing walk, but watch your footing! The trail drops into fields and comes to a junction (30mins). Dhaulagiri, with its spectacular icefall, and Tukuche Peak are stunning from here. Head on and look for a boulder painted with signs – Ghasa is ahead and Lete is right (the Titi Lake trail described above joins here from the left). Continuing, the trail comes to a farmhouse and junction. Turn right into the forest, ignoring a vague path to the left. Watch for monkeys along here. The village of Chhoyo is visible across the main river. Soon you rejoin the main road (1hr).",
                    "Chhoyo is also close to the starting point for the trail toAnnapurna North Base Camp, a route that is currently wild and dangerous. The route crosses the Thulobugin Pass (4310m) to a base camp at 4200m. ACAP hopes to upgrade the ‘upside’ of this trail eventually. They have already constructed a new trail from Chhoyo toGhasa. This avoids the road, passing through a quiet forest and more open countryside above the vast landslide seen from the road lower down. However, it does have a short section of exposure along cliffs.",
                    "Having followed the road, now south of Lete, for less than 10mins, look for a trail steeply off down to the left – oddly, it’s not marked by ACAP. There is a suspension bridge and an abandoned lodge below here. The road does a long loop northwards towards Dhaulagiri – a last look – but you should carefully drop to the sad, empty lodge and bridge. This was a popular stop in the old days. Cross the suspension bridge and climb steeply back up to the road. About 2hrs from Kalopani you reach the teahouse of Ghumaone, where a red/white marked trail heads sharply up and around a landslide, but it seems a waste of effort for the time being and is a very short but hard way to avoid the quiet road. Across the valley a vast avalanche zone provides visual geological evidence of the continual degradation of the mountains.Kaiku(2085m) is the first part of Ghasa, but follow the road down to the path left into the main part of Ghasa, with good lodges (2½–3hrs from Kalopani).",
                    "Ghasa(2010m) is the last of the Thakali villages, with some picturesque houses and a small monastery of the Nyingma-pa sect. The checkpost men will be waiting to pounce here. This section of the trek is now in the deepest part of the Kali Gandaki gorge and towering cliffs dominate the landscape. The rugged and spectacular Thulobugin Ridge and the route to Annapurna I Base Camp are thousands of metres above.",
                    "East bank trail along the Kali Gandaki near Kopchepani",
                    "Join the main road near the empty bus depot and continue to the lower area of Ghasa, with more lodges. The road here is above to the west, while the old trail turns off to the left at the end of lower Ghasa. You could follow this path briefly, but it’s easier just to continue on the road for a few minutes by going right. Come to a sign soon, indicating Tatopani to the left across the suspension bridge – a trail you should take to avoid the road. It is marked in red/white here – this is the old trail with very basic facilities, and the next crossing point is not until near Kopchepani, leading to Rupse Chhara on the road.",
                    "Having crossed the Kali Gandaki, the path is narrow and heads into trees with dry scrub and spindly bamboo. It undulates to an isolated house, then climbs up around the hillside for a while. You get a great view of the road below, with mules making fast headway. Eventually the trail descends toPairothapla(1890m), 1hr from Ghasa, with one basic lodge. Go up through the village and then lose height once more in the scrubby forest. Climb around a small landslide before making a steep descent on loose surfaces down to the sunny fields ofKopchepani(1620m) (1½hrs from Ghasa). At a marked junction, turning right leads below the eroded cliffs to the bridge at Rupse Chhara – an escape route to the main road.",
                    "Going left means another steep climb, but there is a great view of the dramatic Rupse waterfall across the valley. A sign indicates the next adventure: ‘To Tatopani’ and ‘Way to Gadpak’ (Gadpark). Climb uphill; at the top is an old settlement. A small shed-like shrine indicates the presence of traditional animistic beliefs here, with Shaman-style, morbid-looking fetishes outside. Ahead is a view to Dana, as well as another glimpse of the Rupse waterfall. Continue down quite steeply, with care needed over the landslip section, to the riverbank and into the traditional settlement ofGadpak(sometimes spelled Gadpar). Continue below a substantial bouldery, rock-walled zone to the suspension bridge leading to Dana (1400m) and the main road (allow 3–4hrs for the walk from Ghasa).",
                    "Gadpak village",
                    "The trail to Tatopani is to the left here, but it could take another 3hrs this way, with no facilities en route. If it’s getting late, save it for another day, since Dana is a worthwhile short detour. The main part ofDanais right, off the road, up into a quaint old street decked out with flowers, lined by beautiful old merchants’ houses and a few reasonable lodges. The other area of Dana is across another suspension bridge 10mins further on. You could then rejoin the main road and follow it much more quickly to Tatopani. However, you’d be missing out on the section that takes in the famous Miristi (Mristi) Khola and the gateway for mountaineers to Annapurna I – following in the tracks of Maurice Herzog.",
                    "From Dana, cross back over the Kali Gandaki and go right, not up the forbiddingly steep steps, but along the riverbank on a muddy section. There is a junction soon where you need to go right, then shortly go left uphill following the red/white markers. In 15mins scramble over a wall and pass a football ’pitch’. Another wall stile is negotiated, then it’s a great walk along the river in rainforest, serenaded by the ever-harmonic cicadas. The traffic noise – if there is any – is drowned out by the sound of the Kali Gandaki plunging headlong towards the heaving, holy city of Varanasi.",
                    "There are frequent markers now as you climb up steps, but wake up for the exposed narrow bit above the river. Sharap is the next settlement and, just beyond the quiet village, you pass the Tatopani mini-hydro plant. Cross a small concrete bridge and at the junction go right. There is a suspension bridge over the Kali Gandaki here; however, continue straight on and climb around the cliffs, with a short exposed area. Down and then left, go uphill at the next junction to a farmhouse (1½hrs). Yet again you climb steeply, now with some stone steps and more farms. Finally you descend and suddenly there is a view up the mysterious gorge of the Miristi Khola: rugged, densely forested, incredibly sheer-sided and extremely hard to navigate. There is a hint of the Baraha Shikha peak (Fang) in the sky above but, as ever, Annapurna I is hiding her face.",
                    "Cross the Miristi Khola; the bridge was donated by the Agricultural Association of the British Gurkhas in 2002. Next the sign points right to Tatopani. Pass a school with an unusual, sad-looking temple above it. Follow the level path at a small intersection and then the wide track around to a massive rock and, finally, some markers. After a farm you reach a long suspension bridge and cross to the main road. The view of Nilgiri South is superb from this bridge, with poinsettias gracing the foreground. Tatopani is only 10mins along the road; go right for the main street and left for the bus stop.",
                    "Tatopani (1190m) has some pleasant lodges with gardens, and finally a bank, the Nilgiri Vikas. It is famed for its hot springs, which have long been a magnet for sore feet and aching bones. You might be running out of steam in Tatopani, that is, until you see the bus to Beni, making the 1600m climb to Ghorepani a more attractive proposition. Another small bus area is south of the main bridge beyond Tatopani, if no transport is found in the village. Buses leave when overfull and rarely pick up people en route, so it’s take the bus from here, or walk. Stage 4 describes the trekking route from Tatopani to Naya Pul, but the Circuit can be cut short if you wish by following the road from Tatopani to Beni on foot or by bus (see below).",
                    "High above the Tatopani road",
                    "The new motor road enables those short of time to make a dramatic and at times unnerving exit down the Kali Gandaki to Beni, a large, rapidly expanding trading town. An equally hairy road takes you on to Pokhara. You can walk to Beni in 6–7hrs and it’s not that unpleasant following the empty road. Note that you will be deemed to have left the ACAP area after Tatopani on this road and will not be allowed back in – at Birethanti or elsewhere – even on the same day.",
                    "About 45mins from Tatopani there is a great view north of Fang and ahead is a spectacular narrow defile, where the Kali Gandaki is almost choked off. It can be muddy, so be careful, and in less than 2hrs you reach a bridge over the river. Tiplyang (1040m) offers some refreshment and basic lodging. The following forested section is pleasant through to Naya Baishari, where some real tea is on offer at the blue-painted café. Unfortunately after this it starts to seem a long slog, hauling past the Beg Khola Valley and forever on to Galeshwar.Just before Galeshwar is the bridge that leads to the start/end point of the homestay Parbat Myagdi Circular (seeTrek 10).",
                    "Use the suspension bridge in Galeshwar to avoid a long road detour. The Hotel Riverside looks passable for lunch and there are plenty of bananas around. The Mahakala Shiva temple is not normally accessible to foreigners. It’s a dusty road to Beni (830m), 45mins further. The bus and taxi stand is at the entry to town. Hotels here include the Yeti and Deep Shikha, but none are overly enticing. The Beni–Pokhara road is still not sealed as far as the Baglung turn-off, a rough 40mins’ drive. The surface is then fine to Kushma, even if the driving standards are not (taxi Rs3000–4000 to Pokhara). With some exposed corners, a good road (unfortunately perhaps, as the drivers speed up) continues to Pokhara.",
                    "To follow the traditional Annapurna Circuit trail, get ready for a big slog. Say no more! When we first trekked the Annapurna Circuit before roads were invented, the trekking route continued from Birethanti through Chandrakot, Lumle and Naudanda to Sarangkot above Pokhara. According to some, Sarangkot had the finest view of the entire circuit – what a lot of wasted effort, then!",
                    "It’s one very long day to Ghorepani, so many overnight in Chitre en route. There is now a jeep/tractor track snaking its way as far as Sikha (and further up soon enough). The trail heads up in the cool morning shadows into countryside dotted with fields and quaint, picturesque farmhouses. Energetic kids scurrying about and the daily life along the trail are a constant distraction. Forests give some shade higher up, and the views of Dhaulagiri are sensational. Ghorepani means ‘horse water’, harking back to the days when long mule trains dallied here on the long march from Pokhara to Tibet. Two homestay treks (Parbat Myagdi: Treks 9 and 10) can be accessed from Stage 4.",

Cross here to the small settlement and a junction.Going left at this junction is an obscure trail that leads eventually thousands of feet up to the Kopra Danda Ridge (see the Khayer Barah route under Trek 4).Go right to cross another smaller bridge and head up to Sundar’s restaurant in Gharkholagaon village.",
                    "Alternatively, continue along the main road. Crossing the Kali Gandaki on the road bridge further down the valley takes you to an interesting Hanuman temple devoted to the monkey god, who stands on watch. Shortly after the temple, turn sharp left at a sign for Ghorepani (which also leads to Sundar’s restaurant).",
                    "From Sundar’s, follow the jeep track quite steeply up. Ignore a small path to the left, and around the bend zigzag up again to a scruffy sign painted on the rock, ‘Way to Ghare and Ghorepani’. Follow the steep and dusty (sometimes muddy) track and look for shortcut paths. One goes up steeply on the left. Watch for the new bright red spot markers that indicate the way (if they haven’t been washed off by the monsoon rains!).",
                    "At a tree, follow the jeep track briefly then head off to the right on a stone path with more red spots – the old trail. The jeep track is crossed again beside a house, then it’s the trail for a while, steeply up, passing a porters’ resting place (chautaara). Continue to another old porters’ rest spot below the two signature trees of the typical chautaara – the Banyan and Pipal. It’s quite a steep pull uphill on steps and soon it’s even steeper, around the right side of a huge new landslide area. Follow red spots up to the jeep track and the teahouse of Durbin Danda (1550m). The jeep track descends a little to a sign for Ghorepani, left on a grassy trail. This heads into the village ofGhara(1700m) and avoids the jeep track. The trail climbs on through sections of meadows and patches of forest up to the large village of Sikha (Shikha).The jeep road circles off away to the west, but expect sections of it to reappear in the future, even up as far as Chitre.",

Fortunately, the at-times gruelling climb is broken by views of Dhaulagiri. Soon afterPhalante(2300m) isChitre(2390m). Between these two villages is the new homestay trail of the Parbat Myagdi Link trek, heading southwest. This trek (seeTrek 9) can be integrated into the Annapurna Circuit as a variant, ending in Beni, starting from Chitre or Poon Hill.",

This 3–5 day diversion takes you to the panoramic viewpoint of the Kopra Danda – much higher than Poon Hill, with correspondingly more impressive views. The trail heads through the settlement of Swanta (Someta) before making a very steep assault on Kopra Danda. Kopra has a new community homestay, providing those with bags of time the opportunity to witness the very special sunrise here (without the obligatory early morning hike up that Poon Hill demands). Spending two nights in Kopra (3800m) will allow you to trek up the dramatic ridge crest towards Annapurna South and Khairetal Lake (seeTrek 4 Annapurna–Dhaulagiri).",

Trekkers have been embarking on this climb for years, with total justification – it still ranks as one of the most accessible sunrise points in the Himalayas. The panorama stretches from the tangled knots of Churen Himal in the west, through Dhaulagiri, the Kali Gandaki gorge, the Nilgiris, Fang and Annapurna South. The path is well used and obvious, but bring a torch for the pre-dawn light.",
                    "Sticking to the classic Annapurna Circuit, the day offers a return to warmer climes as the trail drops another 1600m to Birethanti – the roadhead near Naya Pul. LeavingGhorepani, the trail descends into rhododendron and magnolia forest, a gentle warm-up in the cool of the morning. Snaking down and around, the path emerges from the misty, atmospheric forest through Nyathanti to reach the small settlement ofBanthanti(2300m). From here Machhapuchhre shines out, its twin-peak ‘fishtail’ exhibited to maximum effect. The trail contours around the hillside then descends, providing endless vistas of terraced hillsides. The largish Magar village ofUlleriis a good place to take lunch or break the long descent into the Bhurungdi Khola.

In winter the next section steeply down beside a waterfall can get icy, especially after snowfall, so be very careful. The waterfall is often frozen by late December. Continue down to anotherBanthanti(2520m), built below a massive cliff (2½hrs). Take a break here; the trail then drops through forest high above the Bhurungdi Valley.",
                    "After crossing a small bridge, the path climbs steeply up though dense, dripping woods toTadapani(2590m, about 4hrs). Surrounded by dense forest, often damp and cold in the afternoon, Tadapani is basically a trekkers’ settlement with lodges. There are three trails from here. One heads north for the Kopra Ridge (seeTrek 4 Annapurna–Dhaulagiri); another goes to Chhomrong via the Kimrong Khola and on to the Sanctuary (seeTrek 2, Alternative Stage 4Chhomrong to Naya Pul via Ghorepani, in reverse). The other trail is the one most commonly used, to Ghandruk, described below.",

Most of this stage is spent in dripping rain-cloud woodland, characterised by ancient moss-covered trees, hanging vines and Langur monkeys. Be careful in the damp sections – the path is often slippery, muddy and covered by tree roots. A few small clearings with isolated teahouses provide trekkers with respite en route. Eventually the trail emerges into terraced hillsides for the last stage down toGhandruk(1940m). The well-used eroded path gets muddy after rain. Ghandruk is one of the larger Gurung settlements, with a traditional old section of slate-roofed houses and neat pathways. A new ‘trekkers’ section has grown now, with modern structures. Here you find two Gurung Traditional Museums and the ACAP area office, which has a regular video show about conservation and ecological matters.",
                    "There is still a very long descent and ascent to negotiate en route to Landruk. The trail snakes down steeply for much of the way, mostly on steps and terraces. The valley of the Modi Khola is always hot and humid. Cross the suspension bridge and start the long climb up the other side of the valley.",

It’s a dying art and a rare sight these days.",
                    "The trail climbs through mixed forest and up through terraces toLandruk/Landrung (1565m) – another Gurung-dominated village. The soul-stirring sunset views are of Annapurna South and Hiunchuli. A new rough dirt track now exists near Landruk, but vehicles are rare.",
                    "Annapurna South from Landruk",
                    "The last stage is no slouch – crossing the Bhichok Deurali Ridge opens up distant panoramas towards Pokhara, but it is Machhapuchhre that utterly captivates the eyes, overwhelming every other vista with its dynamic grandeur. From Landruk the trail contours around the steep hillside toTolka(1700m). Around the next bluff, it’s a steep climb on an energy-sapping path through humid forest toDeurali(2100m). Here trekkers gather to celebrate the last climb of the trek with a drink, while porters rest their heavy loads, catch their breath and light their cigarettes.",
                    "Years ago long lines of porters rested here (and on similar hilltops) smoking theirbedis– rolled tobacco leaves typically found all over India and Nepal that always needed a whole box of matches to keep them alight. Deurali, meaning top-of-the-pass, is also a local brand of cigarette.",

                    "Still one of the most popular hikes across the region, the Annapurna Sanctuary Trek has changed little over the decades. Once the sole domain of sheep and goat herders, the barren meadows of the lower Sanctuary were ‘discovered’ by the outside world in the mid-fifties. Since then, climbers, adventurers, trekkers, lodge owners and porters have carved a trail through the once-formidable bamboo forests and thickets to open up the great amphitheatre of the Sanctuary for recreational use. Being accessible from Pokhara in less than a two-week time frame makes it a perfect destination for those with limited vacations. It can be done in as little as eight or nine days and certainly in just under two weeks, including the Ghorepani add-on routes. Lodges and camping areas are frequent, making this destination ideal for all styles of trekking.",

                    "Although a jeep track has now been constructed up to the Dhampus Ridge, it does not take much longer to walk up on the old trail. From Pokhara take a bus, jeep or taxi to Phedi (or Dhampus). The hike up can be rather sweaty through the forest of sal trees with sections of stone steps. Brahmins, Chhetris and Gurungs inhabit the area.",
                    "To Dhampus (1650m) takes no more than 2hrs from Phedi. ‘Australian Camp’ is the rather odd name of another starting point used by groups located north of the road, close to the villages of Khare and Lumle. FromDhampus(1650m) the route climbs the ridge, passing farmhouse and meadows up toPothana(1890m). The trail from ‘Australian Camp’ joins around here. Pothana has lodges, but it is much more memorable for its astute sellers and souvenir hawkers. When you’ve pulled yourself away, continue the steady climb to BhichokDeurali(2100m), marked by a few rustic shelters and a forest canopy that threatens to obscure the view of Annapurna South.",
                    "The path for Landruk descends through rhododendron forest, often colonised by inquisitive monkeys screeching overhead, to the area of Bheri Kharka/Bhichok. After rainstorms at the beginning of October, this section of trail seems to be inhabited by every blood-sucking leech that ever lived in Nepal – so watch out during those unavoidable loo stops! Contouring around the hillside, the trail goes through cultivated fields toTolka(1700m), high above the Modi Khola. To the south there are distant views of the whole valley as it cuts through the middle hills. The path drops a little as it circles around to the Gurung village ofLandruk(1565m). At sunset you are likely to get a superb view of Annapurna South and Hiunchuli.",
                    "At one time it was necessary to head to Chhomrong via Ghandruk, but the opening of the new bridge in the 1980s made that energy-sapping descent and ascent a thing of the past. The route follows the Modi Khola and, after the bridge, climbs relentlessly to a small pass before reaching Chhomrong.",

Once across the ‘new’ bridge over the Modi Khola to the settlement ofNew Bridge(1340m), the trail begins to climb around to the Kimrong Khola before the hard part begins up toJhinu Danda(1780m). If you take a side trail from here you can visit the hot springs; alternatively make it a short day by overnighting here; otherwise there’s a climb of over 400m toTaglungvillage.",
                    "With the one of the toughest stages over, it’s a pleasant respite ambling on toChhomrong(2170m). The trail drops into this prosperous farming and lodge community.

                    "The term ‘Gurkha’ applies not to any ethnic group of Nepal, but to the tradition of soldiering. The town of Gorkha in central Nepal was the birthplace of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the unifier of modern Nepal, and his armies were known as the Gurkha army. Today the role of the Gurkhas in the British (and Indian) Armies is well known. There is one recruiting base for prospective soldiers near Pokhara, and another near Dharan in the eastern hilly tracts. Chhomrong is home to many ex-Gurkha soldiers (like the famous ‘Captain’, the jolly Captain’s Lodge owner), who retired here and set up the first well-appointed lodges in the 1970s.",
                    "It’s also possible to get to Chhomrong from Naya Pul by taking a jeep to Syauli Bazaar. The valley is heavily cultivated and dotted with typical farms and small settlements.",

Depending on your luck with transport, Birethanti to Chhomrong via New Bridge can be done in one long day, but it’s better to take two days and stay atJhinu Dandafor a hot bath.",
                    "In Syauli you’ll need to ask the way, particularly with the new jeep track making for even more confusion. Allow 2–3hrs to reach New Bridge along the riverbank and watch out for the beehives of the famous honey hunters. Don’t walk on your own; there has been the occasional mugging round here. Once at New Bridge, you’ll have to climb that big hill mentioned in Stage 1 all the way via Jhinu Danda toChhomrong(2170m).",
                    "Woman and child in Chhomrong",
                    "Note that the jeep track from Syauli is expected to reach Ghandruk soon, but for the time being the climb up fromKimche(1640m) toGhandruk(1940m) is quite a hot, sticky affair. From Ghandruk it’s a tough day toChhomrong, with some surprisingly steep ascents and descents, making this option the preferred routeback fromrather thanintothe Sanctuary (seeStage 4).",
                    "Leaving behind the richly terraced and picturesque villages, the route to the Sanctuary passes through wild, untamed forests and high, empty pastures. In fog this upland region is quite reminiscent of North Wales. Only lodge settlements that cater for trekkers are encountered, since herders rarely venture up here these days. Hemmed in by the rugged sheer walls of the incredible Modi Khola gorge, there is little sunlight, giving rise to an often-eerie atmosphere. The mountains are hidden from view for much of the way – that is until you emerge into the open bowl of the Sanctuary, where a tremendous cirque of glittering peaks and spires leaves you giddy with awe.",
                    "The cosy lodges of Chhomrong are left far behind today and the walk will be generally humid due to the dense undergrowth and cloud rainforest.

Sunlight becomes a thing of the past and the path underfoot needs care: roots, muddy areas, streambeds, overhanging bamboo branches, rotting tree trunks and slippery gullies all impede progress. The pace can be slow, so don’t expect to reachBamboo(2335m) early. Although the trail has been upgraded with more steps, it’s not much easier, especially on the knees. From Bamboo toDoban(Dovan) is less than 1hr march. Set in small clearings, the lodges of Bamboo or Doban (2505m) are a welcome sight, offering warming and filling meals.",

On the east side of the canyon, in particular, the cliffs and lower buttresses of Machhapuchhre are sheer and imposing. At dawn the cold air of the deep canyon is bracing, especially for those camping and taking breakfast outside; that’s why most trekkers choose the lodge option on this trek. Once underway, the trail soon penetrates the dense bamboo forest (one quite expects a giant panda to leap out of the undergrowth!). Watch out for the effects of altitude; the trail climbs to over 3700m by the day’s end.",

                    "Not far ahead is the overhanging feature aptly named Hinku Cave (3150m). In the good old days, this sheltered spot once housed a basic lodge. Now no camps or lodges are allowed within the normal avalanche zone of Hiunchuli. That said, there is still the risk of avalanche on this stage of the trail after heavy rain or snow, so take advice from the lodge owners. After the monsoon in early October, in late December/January, and after storms throughout spring, this risk should not be underestimated.",
                    "From Hinku Cave the trail dives across a small ravine and straddles the avalanche debris to climb briefly toDeurali(3230m). Once above the tree line, views open up of the monumental flanks of Machhapuchhre; it’s probably the most sensational buttress zone of any mountain in Nepal that trekkers can pass beneath. AtBagar(3300m) are the remains of what was a great spot to camp – the cliffs across the river were mesmerising to behold. Occasionally when the risk of avalanche is high, the trail is closed and trekkers have to divert across the Modi Khola and continue on the east bank before crossing back to the main track. Otherwise the stiff climb from here remains the last hurdle before reaching Machhapuchhre Base Camp. Beware of rushing on, for in this zone some may fall victim to the effects of altitude sickness.",

                    "For most trekkers, arriving atMachhapuchhre Base Camp(3700m) will be a relief, tinged with a feeling of slight trepidation; altitude affects every individual in a different way, and the degree of discomfort felt will be unpredictable. Going high now is ill advised; be sure to rest, drink plenty and have an early night (remembering not to indulge in a celebratory beer). There is a German-sponsored meteorological station in the vicinity. Don’t be surprised if the whole base camp zone is enveloped by thick, cold cloud – it’s a rare afternoon that is clear in this haunt of the gods. Often as dusk approaches the curtains of clouds draw back and Nature reveals her artistry. Sunset on Machhapuchhre’s West Face is almost beyond description."

                    "The fishtail peak of Machhapuchhre is one of the most iconic mountains of Nepal. Standing at 6993m (22,943ft), it is a sacred peak whose summit is not to be violated. That said, an attempt was made in 1957 by a small expedition led by Jimmy Roberts.",
                    "On 24 April, Base Camp was set just inside the Sanctuary, and from there they chose a route that would take them on to the North Ridge by way of the ice flutings that from a distance looked like pleated curtain. Before gaining the ridge, however, one of the team members, Roger Chorley, was struck down with polio and was carried out to Pokhara in the care of Roberts, leaving just Noyce, Cox and Wylie to continue the attempt with support from their Sherpas. Three camps above base, the trio came on to a ridge and then settled Camp IV under the rock buttress which carries the ridge south to the upper pyramid. From there they could make out the summit obelisk, but the intervening ground was obscured by a short knife-edged ridge which fell steeply to the Seti Khola. But a glacial projection offered a possible way on to a snowy shelf, from which, it was conjectured, the upward route could be carried. Reaching the shelf was an epic in itself, and once there it was found to be ‘a mountain freak’, as Noyce described it. ‘It is supported by nothing and one day will go crashing down into the Seti.’ Fortunately it held, and Camp V was pitched above a large crevasse at about 6400m (21,000ft) on 1 June. At 4.20am next morning, Wilfred Noyce and David Cox made their bid for the summit, which rose nearly 600m above them, ‘a fluted, furrowed series of ribs sweeping straight up to a jagged crest’. Soft knee-deep snow led to easy step-cutting, then they continued round and above a bulbous ‘onion’ of ice, the size of a cottage, which took an age to pass. Out of a clear sky, long rolls of cloud gathered and engulfed the neighbouring peaks. Snow began to fall at 9am, and in worsening conditions they spent the next two hours climbing two ice chimneys, then rounded a rib to discover four or five columns of beautifully polished ice, each of which ended in a skyline pinnacle. Snow fell more thickly now, and after labouring to cut steps up one of the columns, Noyce and Cox called it a day and turned back. They were less than 50m (160ft) from the top. ‘The Goddess had drawn her firm line here,’ wrote Noyce, ‘and with that we must be content.’",
                    "Many trekkers concerned about the additional altitude of Annapurna Base Camp plan to retreat to Machhapuchhre Base Camp for another night rather than stay higher – it all depends on your time frame and how you feel. Staying at Annapurna Base Camp gives a different perspective to this great amphitheatre of mountains. It truly is a land of magical make-believe.",
                    "Although there’s no great distance to travel today, it’s a good idea to start as soon as the sun warms the icy platform where the lodges have been placed to capture the morning rays. Clouds are likely to swallow up the views before lunchtime. The path is clear and climbs steadily. It takes 2hrs or so to reach Annapurna Base Camp (4130m), from where the true scale of the great glaciers below Annapurna I can be appreciated.",
                    "It was above these stupendous glacial tongues that a rock fall killed Ian Clough during the now famousconquest of Annapurna Iby Chris Bonington’s team in 1970, right after the summit successes – an irony only too familiar among these Himalayan giants. Not far from ABC is a memorial chorten to the Russian guide Anatoli Boukreev, who was also killed in 1997 by an avalanche. He was a guide with one of the parties on the controversial Everest expeditions in 1995 when so many climbers were killed.",

Gaining extra height provides yet more spectacular views. All the time the adjacent glacier is melting and crashing away. Across the Sanctuary are the peaks of Tharpu Chuli (Tent Peak) and Singu Chuli (Fluted Peak), both trekking peaks to be bagged by experienced mountaineers. To the west, the encircling cirque of Annapurna South and Baraha Shikha (Fang) forms a formidable barrier. Annapurna I finally looks like the highest of the entourage. To the east is the serrated, razor-like ridge that links Gangapurna, Gandhara Chuli, Annapurna III and Machhapuchhre, illustrating the variety of the Himalayan range at its best.",
                    "The long march down to Chhomrong follows the same route, but the vistas heading south are totally different from those encountered on the approach. The rush of warmer and denser air regenerates the soul as more comfortable altitudes are reached.",
                    "The descent fromAnnapurna Base CamptoMachhapuchhre Base Campcan be accomplished in around 1hr. Descending from high altitude is always relaxing and refreshing, unwinding from the various stresses on body and mind. The retreat down the Modi Khola Valley is, surprisingly, little faster than the ascent, due to the twisted and tangled nature of the forest.

Going ahead, the way gradually loses height as it contours around a series of landslips and then relatively benign side valleys. All along the way is fertile farming countryside, with plenty of opportunity to photograph the people and their activities: carrying water, sowing, ploughing, wood-gathering, harvesting and, often, celebrating a festival. Somewhere not far below Ghandruk you will encounter the advancing jeep track, making the rest of the day easier toBirethanti(1035m) and the scruffy trailhead atNaya Pul(1070m) where you can pick up a bus for Pokhara.",

Here the river is bridged near the scattered houses ofGhurjung(1900m), west of the Ghandruk trail crossing. Thence begins a long, long climb. The trail is quite steep and literally climbs in places over the terraces. (The porters don’t like this section and neither do the farmers, who have to repair the trails, so be careful here.) Gaining height, almost brutally at times, the cool of the forest beckons as you leave the last fields nearChiuli. The forest is cool and inviting – at least during daylight hours – but don’t get caught here after sunset. The forest clearing ofTadapani(2590m) is gained in about 3hrs from Kimrong Khola. Tadapani has some good lodges and it makes a change to stay in the forest for a night.",

The views are wonderful, the village life typical and, being a short trek, it appeals to a wider audience. Such was its popularity in the 1980s that it was easily the most popular group trek and hence acquired the not-too-disingenuous title of the ‘Poon Hill Expedition’ among trek leaders.",

                    "ThePoon Hill Expedition– the daily ritual of sunrise – should not be missed. Enjoy the panoramic plethora of peaks – Churen Himal, Dhaulagiri, the Nilgiris, Fang (Baraha Shikar), Annapurna South and the Kali Gandaki gorge.",
                    "FromGhorepanithe trail snakes down in forest and around to another place called Banthanti (2300m), with views of Machhapuchhre’s fishy tail. The trail descends toUlleri, a good lunch break. A knee-exercising drop on the staircase of a few thousand steps leads toTirkhedunga(1540m). With warmer weather, enjoy the last unwinding stage. Soon it’s almost too warm throughHille(1475m), where there is a jeep track being pushed up fromBirethanti. A bus or taxi to Pokhara can be picked up aboveNaya Pulbazaar.",
                    "With more lodge development north beyond Tadapani, the trek is rarely experienced as a fully supported camping expedition nowadays but camping does allow for some deviations from the route described. Either way, the feast of panoramic views from the Kopra Ridge makes it an outstanding trek. Trekkers heading for the pilgrimage lake of Khairetal, up into the higher country below Annapurna South or cutting east to Chhomrong currently need to camp. The basic route can be done in 10 days, but it’s worth adding a day on the Kopra Ridge in case of heavy snowfalls, which seem to plague the route for part of the season.",
                    "In snow the whole ridge above the Kopra viewpoint is a more daunting and very occasionally dangerous task, with a slight risk of slipping off the trail in one section. However, failing to reach the quiet tarn known as Khairetal is not a disaster if the skies are clear, because the views are amazing. Most groups allow extra time for an intermediate camp on the way to the lake.",
                    "Lodges and homestays are possible in Meshar, Isharu, Dobaato, Bayeli, Chistibung, on the Kopra Danda Ridge and in the village of Swanta. Rumour has it there are homestay developments in Dobaato and in Chistibung now. A new trail is being developed from Kopra to Tatopani, the Khayer Barah Trek (see below).",

                    "In Nepal there is hardly a level section of trail. An easy downhill section is always followed by a steep uphill grind – and so it is with Landruk to Tadapani.",
                    "Referring to two villages on the Arun to Everest Trail,HW Tilman(in his bookNepal Himalaya) exclaimed, ‘For dreadfulness, naught can excel, the prospect of Bung from Guidel.’ The same can be said of ‘Ghandruk from Landruk’!",
                    "The route plunges steeply down to the bridge over the Modi Khola then makes a challenging, sweaty climb toGhandruk(1940m). From here it ascends through a woodland wonderland to the forest enclave ofTadapani(2590m). At night this eerie haunt is more alive than are the sleepy trekkers.",
                    "Breaking away from the main trail here, the route is northwards through thick forest and highland scrub reminiscent of the Scottish moors. This trail has no obvious destination for anyone except trekkers.",
                    "FromTadapanithe morning’s hike is through the cool, damp forests on a rough and little-used herders’ path. There is little sunlight but a plethora of exotic plants and trees – rhododendron, magnolia and a myriad of orchids – and more bird life here than on busy tracks. Be careful navigating among the gnarled trees and twisted roots. New basic lodges are found at Meshar and Isharu en route. Clearings below some rocky crags offer the best places for lunch, where the warmth of the sun is much appreciated. The afternoon walk is once again in thinning forest with a few significant ups and downs toDobaato(3420m), where a new homestay/community lodge has been developed. Mist may hide the snowy summits of Annapurna South, Machhapuchhre and distant Himalchuli in the afternoon, but come the dawn they sparkle brightly.",
                    "It makes a wonderful change to be trekking so close to nature. With so few people on this trail, the wildlife is less wary, giving quiet trekkers a chance to see the shy creatures of the forest.",
                    "The route continues through remote wilderness in the shadow of the lower ramparts of Annapurna South (7219m). AtBayelithere is a community lodge. En route are isolatedbhattis(primitive dwellings) where wild-eyed, roughly dressed men cut wood and others herd their goats on the meadows.Chistibung(3000m), just below Dharamdanda, is the usual night’s stop, being little more than a few terraces, a couple of houses and two new lodges.",
                    "The chill of a misty dawn soon burns off and the distant peaks gain in clarity. The trail climbs and descends almost disconcertingly; the path is often overgrown and muddy underfoot. The final climb to Kopra Ridge is demanding, seemingly never-ending and wild.",

                    "FromChistibungthe route contours around the vast hillside high above the Kholang Khola then drops into the densely forested upper reaches of the Dhasta Khore Khola, a beguilingly complex network of tributaries and gullies. Far below, the deep ravines and damp canyons are disturbed only by the echoing sounds of screeching birds. After a daunting descent, the trail makes a determined effort to gain height via a long and taxing climb: the top is always just a bit further on. And so it goes, with some anticipation of the views to come and the camp ahead already manned by the trekking cook crew; the prospect of hot tea and biscuits can work wonders. One cannot fail to be moved by the staggering vista at today’s destination: theKopra Danda(about 3800m). There is now a community lodge here. Lammergeyers, Himalayan Griffons, vultures, eagles and other large raptors often circle camp here.",
                    "From the camp or homestay lodge near the ridge top, the route basically climbs steadily all the way, with the tantalising peak of Annapurna South periodically screened by the rocky outcrops. The intermediate campsites vary according to the availability of water and the season. Because of deep snow, the authors have twice failed to make it to the lake in the past (giving a 65 per cent chance of success).",
                    "At dawn, as mist obscures the valleys, a sweeping panorama of floating Himalayan giants appears: Churen Himal, Dhaulagiri, Tukuche Peak, Dhampus Peak, Upper Mustang peaks, the Nilgiris, Annapurna I, Fang, and Annapurna South. The Kali Gandaki Valley is far below. Countless hazy blue ridges stretch as far as the eye can discern, towards the Indian border. Tearing yourself away from the vistas, begin the long and arduous climb up the formidable crest of the ridge.",
                    "Given a clear path, getting to the isolated pilgrimage lake of Khairetal and the Baraha shrine (4200m) is rarely insurmountable, so long as you are well acclimatised.",

Dramatic cliffs surround the beautiful, tranquil waters – it is a remarkable place of great serenity, where only the squawking of predatory eagles and vultures pierces the silence. It is not hard to understand how this spot became a significant religious pilgrimage site.",
                    "Take great care retracing your steps, descending the occasionally exposed ridge. The panoramic vistas along this hairy belvedere are spectacular in all directions.",
                    "Be sure to stay at Kopra for sunset; long before the last rays of sunlight desert Dhaulagiri, the sensational colours of dusk are displayed in all their glory: hazy blue tints, jet-black couloirs, silvery cornices, the crisp white snow dappled with fading sunlight and the darkening shadows of the deepest gorge on earth between Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri. Annapurna South and Fang loom large, like giant ogres, to the east, while on the northern horizon millions of stars twinkle above Nilgiri, Tukuche Peak and their companions on the Tibetan border. It’s a magical and memorable sight."

                    "Dhaulagiri is the world’s seventh-highest mountain (8167m/26,795ft). In Sanskrit its name means ‘white mountain’. Admired by thousands of trekkers from the Kali Gandaki and Poon Hill, Dhaulagiri resisted the attempts of mountaineers for longer than comparable peaks. In 1950 Herzog’s French expedition had initially hoped to summit it, but after lengthy reconnaissance decided it was too dangerous, turning their attention to Annapurna I instead. Six attempts on Dhaulagiri via the west ridge followed, but it was not until 1960 that a Swiss expedition finally won through – albeit in controversial style. They used a light aircraft to ferry food, equipment and even climbers to the northeast col at around 5700m (18,700ft). The Pilatus Porter, piloted by daredevils including Emil Wick, eventually crashed on the mountain without loss of life. Austrian mountaineer Kurt Diemberger, a ‘foreigner’ within the Swiss expedition, reached the summit on 13 May, in company with Peter Diener, Ernst Forrer, Albin Schelbert and the Sherpas Nyima Dorji and Nawang Dorji. Two other members (Michel Vaucher and Hugo Weber) also reached the top 10 days later. Attempts since then have tried different routes, but many have perished on the killer white mountain, particularly in avalanches from the notorious Dhaulagiri Icefall.",
                    "Although a tinge of sadness is felt on leaving this lofty viewpoint, there is a certain attraction in reaching the warm climes of Chitre, far, far below.",
                    "The path drops quickly off the ridge towards the distant bright yellow mustard-filled terraces. The trail is knee-crunchingly relentless. Stop for a moment to admire the view of Ghorepani, Poon Hill and the old mule route snaking down towards the Kali Gandaki Valley. Eventually, after scrambling down the tumbling trail to Swanta (Someta), to those once seemingly tiny fields, the route joins the main trail atChitre(2390m). Soon it’s time to celebrate in the mountain metropolis ofGhorepani(2850m).",
                    "Having bagged such a great view from Kopra, you may not be inclined to take on Poon Hill, but if you have any reserves of energy, don’t miss it. FromGhorepanithe trail descends throughBanthanti,Ulleri,Tirkhedunga,HilleandBirethantitoNaya Pul, for the bus to Pokhara – and the cosy lakeside nightspots of the ‘big’ city! SeeTrek 1 Annapurna Circuitfor a detailed description of the route to Naya Pul.",
                    "For adventurous, fit trekkers, this route offers an alternative exit off the Kopra Danda ridge. Unless you can do the 1600m of descent in one day, you’ll need a camping crew, and certainly a guide who knows the way. It’s an exceedingly lonely, wild region, so do not head this way alone under any circumstances; it’s not yet sufficiently developed.",

Another trail is marked on the Himalayan MapHouse map, cutting from the Kopra Ridge directly to Gharkholagaon near Tatopani, but the authors have no information on this option. Anyone looking across the valley from the Ghare–Sikha–Ghorepani trail will have noticed how staggeringly steep and seemingly insurmountable that exciting-looking trail appears. It is essential to take a local guide for either option. The authors have been told that, ‘facilities are needed and supposedly being built, but I didn’t see much progress other than a pile of wooden planks.’ Beware!",
                    "PILGRIMS’ TRAIL – TATOPANI TO JOMSOM/MUKTINATH",
                    "Long before the ‘motorable’ road was constructed from Pokhara to Jomsom, the route up the Kali Gandaki Valley was the sole domain of traders taking goods to Lo Manthang and Tibet and returning with salt from the high plateau. Mule and donkey trains were still a familiar sight on the trail long after the border with Tibet closed in the 1950s. Pilgrims and sadhus also followed this deep canyon to find solace and spiritual uplift at the sacred shrine at Muktinath. Mystics sought sanctuary in the caves around Muktinath. Today the new road has eclipsed the pilgrims’ trekking trail; even pilgrims and some sadhus prefer a bumpy one or two-day ride. Since the inception of the road, few walk the route from Pokhara, Naya Pul or Tatopani to Muktinath (88km/54 miles), so only a brief outline is provided in this book. Accommodation is in lodges, and transport by bus, jeep, plane or even helicopter is available. For a detailed trek description, seeTrek 1 Annapurna Circuit, Stage 3in reverse.",
                    "Expect a long, dusty, rough ride all the way to Tatopani from Pokhara via Beni. Trekking from Tatopani (1190m) to Muktinath taking the alternative trails could be quite attractive, while following the currently quiet road is also a feasible option; allow 7–9 days for the trek. Ghasa is a pleasant place to overnight. After Kalopani the trek along the road from Kokhethanti to Larjung (for Naurikot), Tukuche and Marpha is much easier and more interesting. Across the river before Marpha is Chhairo’s historic monastery. Between Jomsom (2710m) and Kagbeni, take a side trek up to Lubra and its Bon community. No one should miss the trek up to Muktinath (3710m), but be careful of the altitude. Save the Jhong route for the return trip down, as it’s much longer. Return to Pokhara via Jomsom."

                    "North of the main Annapurna range are the isolated regions of Mustang, Damodar and Nar-Phu, areas that were once so remote that almost nothing was known about them. Today, trekkers can enjoy these rugged Tibetan-like landscapes with a degree of basic comfort unknown to earlier explorers.",
                    "Mystical Mustang lies north of the Annapurnas",
                    "Mustang is magical and mysterious. The wild, rugged kingdom north of the Annapurnas hides quaint, picturesque villages, exotically located monasteries, historic treasures and a rich cultural heritage; the landscapes and mountain vistas can only be described as superlative, as befits a real Shangri-La. When Nepal first opened to foreigners, one tantalising region – Mustang – remained firmly shut. Apart from some privileged anthropologists, few other visitors were permitted until 1992.",
                    "Mustang was first mentioned in literature discovered inAD652 in the Silk Route caves at Dunhuang, north of Tibet. It was once part of the Yarlung dynasty that stretched from Tibet into Central Asia. In the 10th century the Tibetan Bon and the Korsum dynasty of Ngari ruled. After the Menshang nomadic tribes, the Jumla kingdom and then the Gunthang kings of Tibet controlled Mustang, before the Menshang reasserted their power. Later the Buddhist master, Ngorchen Kunga Sangpo, briefly administered the region, before it fell yet again under Jumla (then ruled from Tsaparang by the Guge kings of Western Tibet). With the rise of the Sakya-pa order in Tibet, Mustang adopted the same sect.",
                    "The Mustang we see now was established under King Amapal (1388–1447). Amapal extended the rule of Lo as far as Purang in Guge. Mustang prospered through the trade between lowland Nepal and Tibet. Links with Ladakh enriched the cultural heritage until 1768, when Prithvi Narayan Shah took control of all Nepal. The Raja of Mustang joined the new state of Nepal, but ruled independently.",
                    "After 1950, when Tibet fell under new masters, Khampa freedom fighters used the isolated valleys as bases. However, when Nepalese monarch King Birendra announced the ‘Zone of Peace’ initiative, they left Mustang. The land reverted to its former status as a peaceful forbidden last frontier.",

It takes place during the seventh–eighth month of the Tibetan year.",
                    "The optimum period to trek in Mustang is early autumn, when the skies are clear, the monsoon rains have abated and the harvest is in full swing. One possible drawback is that flights to Jomsom can still be disrupted by bad weather, entailing delays and cancellations. Winter is too cold for most; some lodges close and many residents, including the king, migrate south for the winter. Late spring is attractive – the higher altitudes offer pleasant trekking, clear views and cool temperatures – although winds can be a negative factor. The monsoon is often cited as the main season to visit, due to the rainshadow effect of the Himalayas, but cloud is likely, and flights and roads to Jomsom from rain and cloud-engulfed Pokhara are severely disrupted. Avoid the monsoon.",
                    "Mustang Tetang",
                    "The style of the trek and the altitude gains dictate the itinerary. Camping is more flexible, while distances between villages determine night stops for lodge trekkers. Most villages along the main trail now have lodges, of varying standards. Between Chele and Ghami, altitude (3000–4000m) becomes a factor in deciding the night stops, especially for lodge trekkers. However, once acclimatised, the route is relatively moderate.",
                    "More trekkers are taking the eastern trail between Lo Manthang and Tetang, about as sensational as trekking gets in Mustang. The cultural highlights and sheer scale of the extravagantly sculpted, contorted, eroded scenery are stupendous. The astonishing stage from Tange to Tetang is highly recommended for those not doing the complete eastern side route. Few take it, citing a lack of water on the arid east side of the Mustang Khola – there is only a trickle near Pa (4210m), about halfway. Carry a huge amount of water and endeavour to do it all in one very long but thrilling day.",
                    "The stages described in the following routes correspond roughly to daily marches (based on camping), but levels of acclimatisation could modify some days. Allow a few extra days for flight delays between Pokhara and Jomsom.",
                    "There is no greater adrenalin rush than a mountain-dodging flight in the Himalayas to a stunningly located airstrip, and Jomsom is no exception. Flying between Annapurna and Dhaulagiri above the Kali Gandaki gorge is sensational. You’ll need more than a few minutes to catch your breath after the dramatic landing at Jomsom before trekking on to Kagbeni.",
                    "As the dirt road has developed, some trekkers have sought alternative routes to walk between Kagbeni and Lo Manthang. Already work is being done to allow trekkers to keep to the west bank of the Kali Gandaki/Mustang Khola between Kagbeni and Samar. Passing through a region known locally as Seke, the planned trail goes through Tiri and over the Mani La pass (3800m) to Samar. Further north, many groups now follow the western trail between Ghami and Lo Manthang via Drakmar to avoid the road. A trail also goes over a high ridge between Drakmar and Tsarang, an historic village that should be included in any trek. North and East of Lo Manthang the impressive historic Buddhist cave shrines of Chosar, Konchok Ling, Samdzong and Chodzong are just waiting to be explored. Finally, a number of options link Damodar Kund and Tange with the isolated Khumjungar and Bhrikuti Base Camp as well as the region adjacent to the Teri La pass. For much more detail on the new treks in Mustang seeMustang: The Untrodden Trailsby Paulo Grobel, Sonia Baillif and Etienne Principaud, published by Himalayan MapHouse, Kathmandu, 2015 and translated into English by Siân.",
                    "Road development has changed Upper Mustang. From Kagbeni the dirt track has been opened to Lo Manthang, while from the north a restricted Chinese-built road crosses the Kora La (4660m) to Lo Manthang. A maze of other little-used dirt tracks go to most locations adjacent to the main road, as well as towards Yara and the Samdzong La pass. Stages described do not always indicate day stages.",
                    "Fortunately few suffer any ill-effects adjusting to the sudden altitude gain experienced on landing at Jomsom. The trek crew needs to check all the loads/permits, so tea is in order. The trail from Jomsom follows the Kali Gandaki Valley past the Lubra Valley through Eklobhatti toKagbeni(2800m). Kagbeni, like many villages in Upper Mustang, has low tunnel alleyways that give protection from the wind.",
                    "With formalities over, great excitement ensues afterKagbeni, the last frontier (or lost horizon) before entering the domains of Shangri-La. If you don’t plan on using the Tange to Tetang route at the end, do go to Tetang for the first night – it’s a unique, fabulous medieval place with a stunning setting (and a new lodge). Add a couple of extra hours to the time to reach Samar the following day.",
                    "Soon the east bank trail climbs steeply and traverses a number of gullies characterised by eroded turrets and dry cliffs. Looking back, Kagbeni is framed by the fluted spires of Nilgiri. Local horsemen splash happily along the riverbed.The new dirt road alters the route where it cuts the trail or utilises bridging points.",

                    "Local Mustang child and baby",
                    "From here the path climbs to about 3100m, with views dominated by multi-coloured cliffs before descending to the village ofChuksang(2980m). The major side canyon of the Narsing Khola is an example of the amazing eroded landscape of Mustang, where the soft layers of rock have been modified into chimneys, ‘organ-pipe’ features and fairytale gullies. The trail skirts below a ruined fort and soon reaches a striking red canyon. The route bridges the Kali Gandaki (now the Mustang Khola) as the river struggles to find a way through the narrow defile. It’s a short climb toChelevillage (3050m).",
                    "It’s a leisurely day to aid acclimatisation, since the trail beyond Samar is generally above 3700m. Keeping west of the Mustang Khola, this stage negotiates a dramatic canyon. If you are camping, there are suitable places further along, but beware of the height gain on this day. The peaks of Damodar Himal are visible to the east.",
                    "The morning exertions involve a steep climb through a dramatic canyon west of the main valley. The village of Ghyakar, set among fields of buckwheat, lies across the main gorge here, as the path hugs the canyon walls. Be careful – the drops are scary as the path continues to climb. Salt oozes from the cliffs. Panoramic views to the south from the Dajori La pass (3750m) reveal Nilgiri, Tilicho Peak and Yakwa Kang – the peak above the Thorong La. A short descent to the larger settlement of Samar (3660m) follows.",
                    "Constantly inspiring views make this another day to savour. Geling has a small monastery. A rugged alternative route (between Samar and Syangmochen) visits the stunning monastery of Chungsi Ranchung Cave. In October the buckwheat harvest is underway and is fun to watch. If you have any surplus energy, you might like to join in!",
                    "The route continues from the chorten of Samar and negotiates a couple of deep side canyons before passing through an isolated zone of ancient juniper and the remnants of a long-denuded woody glade. It then climbs to a small col at about 3750m. About 2hrs from Samar on the descent is a teahouse. Chungsi (3820m), with a flat area for tents and shelter, is a further 1hr walk after yet another canyon.",
                    "From Chungsi the trail crosses a small pass at 3870m before dropping through pleasant, lusher surroundings to Syangmochen, with excellent lodgings and a superb Kali Gandaki Canyon sunset viewpoint. Otherwise there is a short climb to a pass and then a chorten with views of Geling village. However, a further 45mins are needed to reach the settlement, because another side canyon interrupts the rhythm. Take an extended break in Geling (3570m), with its intriguing, dingy alleys and a monastery to explore.",
                    "From Geling the route climbs to the substantial pass of Nyi La at 4010m. There is a false summit and it seems a never-ending slog to the top. The descent is equally long and even steeper down to Ghami (3520m). There is a monastery to visit, but beware of big growling dogs after dark.",
                    "The main route between Ghami and Tsarang (also called Charang) follows the new dirt road, but with only a handful of jeeps or less all day it’s not much different from the old wide trail. Tsarang has an exotic, ancient ambience displaying the cultural uniqueness of Mustang and should not be missed. (It can be visited on the return from Lo Manthang to Kagbeni if going via Tange and Muktinath.)",
                    "Tsarang",
                    "FromGhamithe trail passes a trio of chortens, then crosses a gully by a bridge. About 30mins from Ghami is a very long mani wall. From the trail junction, a dramatic red-walled cliff area can be seen rearing up in the direction of Drakmar. About 2hrs from Ghami is a small pass, theChoya La(3770m), followed by a couple of hours of pleasant, easy ambling toTsarang(3560m). The mud-walled ramparts of the tremendous fortress-citadel dominate the village. The stunningly located monastery has some amazingly intricate murals and mandalas, gradually being restored. A much-revered, wooden statue of Chenresig (Avalokiteshvara) in the gompa was brought from Lhasa. East of Tsarang are the monastery of Dri, the Yara caves and the Luri Cave retreat en route to Damodar Kund, a sacred pilgrimage lake – mentioned in the box below.",
                    "The prospect of reaching the fabled walled city of Lo Manthang – the highlight of the whole trek – makes this a fabulous day full of anticipation.",

Climbing out of this substantial ravine reveals a splendid Himalayan panorama to the south: Annapurna I, Nilgiri and Tilicho; and Bhrikuti Peak to the southeast. About 2hrs from Tsarang the route passes a much photographed, isolated, beautiful chorten. The gently ascending trail passes spectacular cliff caves and crosses a stream. Cliffs of yellow conglomerates and dark bands flank the route as it climbs to the next pass – theLo La(3850m). Within minutes a wonderful window opens over Lo Manthang – the fabulous city below, a spectacular sight greeted with incredulity.",

                    "Virtually untouched by modernity, the walled city is an extraordinary sight, with its white houses, red monasteries and palace. This viewpoint reveals other treasures: Tinghar Gompa, Namgyal Gompa – the red and grey-coloured edifice on a promontory – and Phuwa village. The Mustang Khola, hemmed in by a veritable sea of coloured cliffs, lies to the east. To the northwest, Mansail peak rises in a crescendo of barren ramparts to its white cap. The rapid descent is short and, once across the river, the gates ofLo Manthang(3800m) await.",
                    "When Mustang first opened in 1992, little literature was available, apart from the writings of Michael Peissel; few people had explored southwest of Lo Manthang. Today another route links Ghami to Lo Manthang through this area, avoiding the new dirt track that runs between Tsarang and Lo Manthang. To avoid repetition, try this route northbound if you plan to return through Tsarang to Dhi, Yara and Muktinath via Tange and Tetang.",
                    "From Ghami the trail runs north along the Drakmar Khola or across the shoulder of the hill north of Ghami (with good views) and on to Drakmar (3820m). The setting of Drakmar is astonishingly spectacular, with incredibly etched turrets, towers and caves carved in the brilliant red and ochre cliffs. Drakmar has two lodges and a small monastery – all around the corner in a side valley."

During their tussle, so it is said, her blood was spilt, creating the red-coloured cliffs. Her intestines transformed into a long mani wall. The large chorten before Drakmar holds down her heart, with smaller chortens covering the spots of her spilt blood, hiding the remnants of her powers.",

Samdrupling was once a sacred Buddhist centre, noted for sky burials. After a couple of viewpoints the day concludes at the fabled city of Lo Manthang (3810m). There are six or seven lodges in Lo Manthang of differing quality.",
                    "The extraordinary walled city of Lo Manthang is worthy of UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Roughly 180 houses exist within the 8.5m-high walls, built by the Amapalas. The big chortens of Lo Manthang house relics of the Buddha. The four-storey palace of the Mustang monarch, King Jigme Dorje Dradul (his Nepalese name is Jigme Palbar Bista), was constructed in 1440. In the early days, when Lo Manthang first opened, the King and Queen of Mustang invariably entertained trekkers and visitors at the Royal Palace; its quaint medieval atmosphere is impressive. Anyone fortunate enough to be given a very rare audience with the abdicated monarchs today should delight in their generous offer of quality Tibetan butter tea. One cup should be enough to show gratitude, but anyone leaving their tea decades ago might have feared for their head!",

The Sakya-pa structure was consecrated in 1448 under the auspices of Ngorchen Kunga Sangpo. The painted image of Maitreya was completed in 1663. The monastery is famed for its abundant and now restored mandala images, originally produced by Newari artists under King Kunga Zangpo. The Sakya-pa Tugchen Lhakhang (Mahamuni) or ‘Great Sage’ Gompa was initiated in 1468 under King Tsangchen Trashigon. It has a magnificent image of the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Vairocana, above the entrance facing east. There are prominent images of Guru Rinpoche, Ratna Sambhava, Vajradhara and a bird-like Kirtimukha. The main icon is Mahamuni, flanked by Shadukshur Lokeshvara and Manjushri. A major restoration programme was conducted here in 1999–2004 under the auspices of the American Himalayan Foundation. The Choide Gompa (1710) was initiated by King Tsewang Phuntsok Tsugyen Norbu. It features an impressive Mahakala. Choprang Sakya-pa Gompa is the newest structure.

The extensive Chosar cave system (including Sijha Dzong cave) dates to 800BC, with 40 or more chambers. In the Bon Mardzong (Makhchung on maps) cave outcrop anthropologists discovered 13th-century paintings and manuscripts executed in silver and gold. The Luri Cave Gompa has some amazing frescoes painted by Newari artists from the Kathmandu Valley in the 12th century.",
                    "Excavations have revealed that a substantial civilisation inhabited much of the Trans-Himalayan region, encompassing the Lo region, Damodar Himal and Tsaparang in Western Tibet. From 1992–97, digs around the Mehbrak caves revealed the grave of a mother and baby along with food offerings. It was dated to around 450BC. Since then over 60 more such corpses have been discovered, some with food items in ceramic vessels.",
                    "Initially the finding of mass graves or burial sites was attributed to landslides, but the theory was soon discounted. Now it is almost certain that the cave dwellers practised sacrificial rituals.",
                    "Taking only a morning, this is a great option from Lo Manthang. It lies southeast of the city close to the Dokpolo Khola and the upper reaches of the now-diminished Mustang Khola. The ‘white mountain’, a towering conical peak of dazzling white rock known locally asSakau Danda(4039m), is a superb feature en route. Access to the strange, ghostlyMardzongoutcrop that hosts the caves is almost impossible, and in any case it is necessary to wade across the river.",
                    "Konchok Ling hosts some exquisite, if faded, cave paintings. The one-way 3–4hr trek to the grotto shrine is one of the most spectacular walks in Mustang! It’s not the best trail in the region and requires some care, being steep with severe exposure in a few places as it stumbles up and down later around the turrets. Avoid this in snow or bad weather. Two almost-vertical steel cables allow access to the precariousKonchok Lingcave grotto. The multi-coloured formations and fantastic unworldly scenery on the way make this side trip worthwhile, even if the cave is not visited.",
                    "The high country of the Mustang Himal northwest of Lo Manthang has recently been traversed by climbing groups, but the routes are technical and not for regular trekkers. However, trekkers do have the 4–5 day option of visitingMansail Base CampfromNyamdoincluding a camp at theLongkyok Tso Lake. Currently the climbing permits for peaks in this area and others are actually cheaper per person than the US$500 plus that trekkers are being charged!",

The local people are still somewhat reticent about the intrusions of foreigners. Even further east are the mysterious cave sights ofChodzong. The late 14th and early 15th century Chodzong monastery is known as the ‘castle of the dharma’ and hosts Indo-Newari style artwork.",

However, a circular, fully supported camping option, arranged at vast expense in Lo Manthang, will take 4–5 days, including a crossing of theChodzong La(4450m). Costs quoted locally were up to US$100 per person per day for two trekkers and negotiable for a bigger group. Of course this excursion needs to be considered when obtaining the Upper Mustang permit.",
                    "Until more recently, only camping trekkers explored the spectacular sights of Buddhist art found at Yara and Luri. With quite acceptable lodges in Dhi, Yara, Ghara and Tange it is now possible to return from Lo Manthang to Muktinath on a completely different route south.",
                    "Yara village and cliffs",
                    "The easiest route is from Tsarang down the road and then east viaDhi, where another dirt track leads toYara, with some impressive caves set among fairytale scenery. However, the more spectacular route is along the high and wild Udi Danda ridge. It’s a long day (6–7hrs) to Yara, with lunch in Dhi. The descent into Dhi is dramatic, down a narrow chasm with some exposure and loose sandy detritus. From Yara most trekkers do a circular day trip up to Ghara (for the key lady) and then on to the stunningly located Luri Cave. The cave houses Guru Rinpoche, but is mainly noted for the artistry of the ceiling and an exquisitely painted chorten. Close by is Luri Gompa and down the river, the sometimes inaccessible treasures of theTashi Kabum cave. The return to Yara is along the riverbed with a short climb up. Another long (6–8hrs) but very spectacular trek crosses two high passes to Tange. There is a lunch teahouse at Hotel Riverside on the south bank of the Dhechyang Khola canyon that cuts the route dramatically. To visit Dhey to the east, camping is required. The more popular route from Tange to Tetang and Muktinath is described below. For more details on these routes, seeTrekking around Upper & Lower Mustang/A Trekking Guide to Mustangby these authors and published by Himalayan MapHouse/CreateSpace-Amazon 2016.",

                    "The day is full of unworldly, amazing sights: the rugged canyons of the Mustang Khola, and the picturesque, atmospheric village of Tange – a place far removed from reality. Four new lodges in Tange make this destination a very attractive option but crossing the Mustang Khola and the Tange Khola is not always feasible when the rivers are high. In that case, going to Yara from Tsarang or taking the whole eastern route mentioned above is a better option. however, it adds two days to the itinerary.",
                    "The trail fromTsarang(3560m) to Tange departs from near the monastery, southeast through the fields. A gap in the wall heralds the start of a sensational descent into the Mustang Khola riverbed (300m). Initially in a hidden ravine, the steep, loose track descends into a colossal dry gully dominated by weirdly eroded chimneys and turrets. The very narrow, deep defile virtually spits the trail out into the Tsarang Chu canyon, leading eventually to the wide and stony Mustang Khola. A small chorten marks the spot about 1hr from Tsarang.",
                    "Following the valley floor, the trail comes to a river junction with the Dhechang Khola (3200m) and continues south. The canyon of the Mustang Khola is about 200m wide here and on both sides are towers, hermit caves, cliffs and organ-pipe features. The undisturbed riverbeds are famed for their fossils, particularly ammonites.",
                    "Continue along the Mustang Khola before turning left into the canyon of the Tange Khola. The valley floor is criss-crossed by rivers and streams, necessitating a number of wading sessions. About 1hr along the valley, the trail climbs left intoTange(3240m). The village is an astonishing sight, with multiple chortens of bright red and white. Framing the whole medieval mud-walled scene is an amazing, dry, fluted sandstone cliff with troglodyte caves favoured by the hermits and sages of old. It’s a little-visited wonder of Mustang.",
                    "Don’t expect an easy day from Tange (3240m) to Tetang (3040m), but enjoy the stupendous sights – the deepest gorge in the world between Annapurna and Dhaulagiri along with the strange geological apparitions of the ghostly upper Narsing Khola.

Where black soil and oozing salt are encountered, there is a good view back over Tange as it wakes from its slumbers. Meanwhile, the dogs are no doubt retiring for the day. After crossing the Yak Khola, the way is soon steeply up for around 900m, a very long climb indeed. Fortunately tantalising views north of high, rugged and barren peaks unfold en route.",
                    "Nearly 4hrs after leaving Tange, the trail reaches theSoye La passat about 4300m and suddenly the pain of the ascent dissipates (for a while) as the sharpened spire of Dhaulagiri rises skywards. Prayer flags adorn the pass cairn and it’s possible to pick out the inbound trail between Samar and Syangmochen west across the chasm of the Mustang Khola. About 30mins on is the only feeble waterhole on the route atPa (Paha)(4210m). The trail ahead climbs and contours around various bluffs, reaching an estimated altitude of 4230m about 6hrs from Tange. To the west are the forbidding, serrated ridges that enclose Mustang and divide it from Tibet.",
                    "Contouring for another hour brings you to the rim of the Narsing Khola canyon. The breathtaking scenery is so fantastic that there is a risk of drifting off the narrow trail. In places drops of over 1000m on one side or the other are mind-boggling, with considerable exposure. This stage has the most sensational scenery of the whole trek; a series of gigantic organ-pipe features cascade into the contorted chasm below, topped with turret-like towers. In this vast zone of extraordinary natural sculptures mysterious holes in the soft conglomerate walls of the turrets reveal alarmingly sheer drops into the murky Narsing Khola defile below. It’s a truly unbelievable sight.",

                    "The canyon rim here is sometimes less than 2m wide and the trail snakes around it for a while. Don’t stray too close to the edges; the rock is soft and unstable. Eventually the trail leaves these ungodly zones and crosses a flat region, where the V-shape of the Kali Gandaki gorge slashing through the Himalayas can be seen. Well into the afternoon, the path eventually makes its descent into the cones of the organ pipes again. The trail is rough, loose and steep and, after such a long day, care is essential. At a junction, take the left fork (the right fork goes down to Chuksang).",
                    "Warning: Constant erosion has made the steep descent to Tetang through the turrets rather scary, slipping down narrow crumbling sections with long drop-offs. Go via Chuksang and come back up to Tetang along the dirt road if this sounds too dangerous. Otherwise, with some relief you drop to a colourful chorten before crossing the river into the willow trees. Carry on up the creek to Tetang (3040m), with an excellent new lodge.",
                    "The two-part village ofTetangis amazing; the walls of the outer houses are 10m high, giving the place a fortified appearance. The village has a good drainage system and a maze of mysterious dark alleys, low archways, tunnel-like lanes and eerie doorways. The eastern part is uninhabited and crumbling but has an interesting monastery hiding some large statues behind murky glass. The other area is used and has a sunny central square amongst all the dingy alleys, secret doors and dark corners. An ancient salt mine lies about 1hr along the drama-filled narrow defile of the Narsing Khola. It would be delightful to stay an extra day in Tetang, except for the wretched permit timing and planning issues. After Tetang you might think the trek is all over, but there’s one final surprise in store.",
                    "The trail climbs as it passes a long mani wall to a rocky area. A small pond appears higher up and then it’s onwards and upwards through bands of dark scree and shale. Head east into a narrow valley where more shale and oozing salt lie underfoot, as well as a spring surrounded by greenery. The trail now leaves the main valley, turning south up a smaller tributary valley and climbing for 1hr to theGyu La(4080m). A magnificent view of Tilicho Peak unfolds, one of the most beautiful, glittering snowy walls of the Annapurnas, with its delicately cascading fluting. Its sheer size is staggering – grandeur unsurpassed at such close range. It is the highlight of the day.",
                    "The hike down is pleasant and easy via Chhyonkar village before joining the main trail atMuktinath(3710m), with its good lodging and ‘fooding’, heralding a return to the busy byways of the Annapurna Circuit.",
                    "Back on familiar territory now, there remains only the ambling descent to Jomsom to complete the trek; or take a jeep if you dare! SeeTrek 1 Annapurna Circuitfor fuller details on this stage. Most Mustang trekkers then normally fly to Pokhara.",

From here the route is through very wild and isolated country. The next day is usually a shorter stage but involves the crossing of the highKyumu La pass(5300m) before camping atBatsyak. Trekkers need to be well acclimatised to the altitude for the next pass, theBatsyak La(5450m), and then the trail passes the so-called French Camp to the Damodar Kund lakes (4890m). Those with added time can make a side trip to theBhrikuti Shail Base Camp(5800m), often cited as the source of the Kali Gandaki.

It has a lot to offer curious and adventurous trekkers. Far, far removed from modern times, the hidden valleys have retained their ancient Tibetan-orientated culture, something that is virtually lost in mainstream Tibet. Pisang Peak and Kang Guru, a rarely seen peak, dominate the horizons. Only opened to trekkers in 2002–03, these magical valleys are now attracting attention. With so few inhabitants, the Nar-Phu region is a naturalist’s paradise.",

There are, of course, sections of path that are a pure delight; through cool pines, across dry meadows dotted with sweet-smelling juniper and beneath towering snowy ranges. The wild terrain is contorted and uncompromising. Obtaining proper insurance is vital for both trekkers and staff. This is no place to have an accident, so care and concentration on the way are vital.",

Late December is very cold and, if snow comes early, many people migrate from Phu and Nar to warmer zones, meaning the few lodges could close. The authors began their trek in late March, but at this time snow lingers in some shady corners and below frozen waterfalls, making the first day from Koto to Meta testing in a few places. Wind is a particular feature of the spring, usually gently down-valley from the north in the morning and gusting wildly uphill in the afternoon. By April the trail is cleared for ponies, making this month and May attractive (although the approach march from Besisahar will be hotter). The monsoon period is recommended by some, because the villagers are busy with the growing season, meadows blossom for grazing animals and the two schools are open. However, the walk into Koto from the leech-infested and rain-soaked middle hills will be very taxing, and landslides could disrupt plans.",
                    "There are three ways to plan this trek. All require a guide or porter/guide, and taking an extra porter from Koto is advisable. Don’t expect your staff to carry much more than 12–15kg, due to the nature of some sections of the trail. Carry emergency food supplies that do not require cooking, so that you can have a picnic lunch any time, anywhere.",

Don’t forget a small thermos flask for tea or coffee, as well as sugar, and loads of chocolate/glucose tablets for energy. There is no food anywhere between lodges. Apart from a few streams, water is located at Singenge Dharmasala and Kyang. Sometimes there is water at Gulung en route to Nar. There is no water at the seasonal herder settlements of Chyk, Junam or Chyako. Remember the sterilising tablets. Since lunches may be only chapattis, daily expenses are comparable with the Annapurna Circuit.",
                    "A compromise on the above would be to bring a lightweight tent for one or possibly two nights (including Nar Phedi). Of the five other trekkers the authors encountered, three were fully supported and two stayed in lodges, carrying a tent but no cooking equipment. Food in the lodges is simple but adequate for a week or so, particularly if supplemented with your own reserves and favourite goodies.",
                    "Whichever way you do it, be sure to ask whether your crew members have been there before. The authors’ guide and Koto-employed porter had both done the trek several times and were fully conversant with the conditions and availability of water/accommodation. This was not the case with the other teams encountered.",
                    "There is currently electricity in Meta, Phu and Nar for all those modern devices that need charging. You can extend the life of your batteries by waring them inside your clothing.",
                    "Yaks on the bridge to Nar",
                    "The seven-night itinerary described is the one planned and followed by the authors. On the walk-in from Besisahar, we spent a night in Timang, the highest overnight spot before reaching Koto, and also allowed ourselves the luxury of a day off in Koto, visiting Chame from there for the morning. It is possible that spending three nights at around 2600–2700m before entering the Nar-Phu area helped our altitude acclimatisation. Ideally, given time, going to Pisang for acclimatisation would be the best option.",
                    "The first day from Koto to Meta is long and gains over 900m. From Meta, it is not recommended to go to Nar first, because of the altitude gain and very steep ascent. A day trip to Nar does not really allow enough time to savour the delights of the village. The trail to Phu makes an intermediate stop in Kyang, with altitude gains of no more than 300m per day. It’s perfectly possible to descend from Phu to Nar Phedi or Meta in one long, punishing day.",
                    "Beyond Nar the Kang La is often snowbound and is desperately steep down into Ngawal. Our experienced climbing guide (and cook) suggested trekking teams would be advised at the very least to carry an ice axe and ideally have ropes and crampons.",
                    "To access the start of the trek at Koto from Besisahar, please refer to Trek 1 Annapurna Circuit for details of the route.",
                    "The level of anticipation is almost unbearable as you contemplate the incredibly narrow entrance to this domain of lost horizons. It’s a day of mostly ‘up’, but there is some respite with a few short descents. Although no food was available en route in the past, there is now a teahouse where basic dhal bhat is served (always check at Koto if it is open).",
                    "From the checkpost and kani, the trail heads steeply down to cross the Marsyangdi River. Immediately the trail is quiet and peaceful through forest of blue pine and larch. Within 30mins there is an overhanging sheer cliff where the way has been carved out of the rock face. If you find it too intimidating, consider turning back now! An easier forest section and a steady climb follows to another narrow zone about 2hrs from Koto. Look back for a glimpse of Lamjung. Soon spindly bamboo blocks out the steep drops to the side of the path.",
                    "On the trail to Meta",
                    "About 2¼hrs from Koto, the trail crosses to the east bank and, shortly after some zigzags, crosses the foaming white side stream of the Seti Khola. There is a toilet and camping area with water. Basic lunch can be bought here, if the teahouse is open. The trail climbs rigorously now for 30mins to a glade of massive trees. Shortly a sign directs the walker on to the lower path to the cave shelter ofChhongche(2935m), reached in 4hrs or so.",
                    "From here the trail mostly climbs as the route approaches a narrower part of the canyon with sheer walls towering to the sky far above, totally unimaginable in scale. About 5½hrs from Koto the trail crosses to the west bank and shortly comes to an overhang called Hulaki Odar, beside a beautiful waterfall and ravine. The ACAP sign implies it’s only 1¼hrs to Singenge Dharmasala, but don’t believe a word of it. Through the narrow defile there is some more exposure.",
                    "About 15mins up from Hulaki, the route crosses back to the east bank. Here there is a small hot spring (although how one is supposed to access it down a precarious carved log staircase is anyone’s guess). Ahead the path crosses the first of two evil and exposed snow chutes from avalanche areas thousands of metres above. Take care here! A short narrow section follows to another snow chute, but here trees below provide a reassuring buffer. About 6hrs from Koto, the trail dives behind a dramatic waterfall with the path protected by a rock tunnel blasted out of the cliff.Singenge Dharmasala(3210m) is little more than 30mins ahead, but is a dreary, damp and uninviting place to stay. Campers concerned about the altitude might be forced to spend the night here. The ACAP shelter, sponsored by the Hong Kong Kadoorie Foundation, is sadly still in ruins but a large single-room hut has now been placed on the site.",
                    "There is a brief glimpse of the elusive Kang Guru. Since leaving Dharapani (on the way to Koto from Besisahar) you have virtually encircled the peak without ever seeing its main summits. The dreaded steep climb to Meta begins now and it’s tough at the end of the day. As encouragement, the welcome chorten of Meta can be seen in 30mins, but still perched very high above. There is a rough open shelter in 15mins and, after crossing a side stream, the path climbs the ravine on a path characterised by loose detritus. The last stage is across the meadows through juniper to the slopes ofMeta(3560m).",
                    "Lamjung from Meta",
                    "Meta is a permanently inhabited settlement formerly used by Khampa guerrillas after the Chinese move into Tibet in 1959. Today it has six already-functioning lodges, including a new modern one and a more basic place near the checkpost. This is not always manned, but from time to time catches those who try to sneak into the area without permits. There are around 20 stone houses here and a small school. The food is excellent and the lodges comfortable, with ‘deluxe thickness’ mattresses and acceptable toilets!",
                    "The day begins with a pleasant contour around the hillside, but this is not indicative of the day overall, which is almost all uphill. The views ahead towards the Tiri La, which links Nar to Tange in Mustang, are incredible and well illustrate the typical terrain of the region. Nar village is hidden behind the high bluffs to the northwest, and far below is the strange new red monastery of Nar Phedi.",
                    "Traditional nomadic weaver in Chyk",
                    "Within 1hr the trail passes above the temporary settlement ofChyk, where herders graze their goats and yaks on the meagre grasses and bushes. Ahead is a mountain that’s off the map and northeast of Phu, called Ratna Chuli. Huge Himalayan Griffons glide above in search of prey. The stiff climb continues through patchy areas of ancient juniper trees and bushes to Junam (2½hrs from Meta). Previously a waterless, abandoned settlement of crumbling stone shelters,Junam(3670m) now has both water and a teahouse. Shortly beyond the grassy meadows, the path plunges abruptly into a deep ravine characterised by moraines that drop from the western glacier of the hidden Kang Guru. In the dry season the path snakes down around the moraine and climbs back out of the twin ravines, but there is also a new bridge for the summer high-water period.",
                    "From Junam the trail climbs steadily to a chorten of three parts (Rigsum) and past the abandoned houses at Chyako/Chyakhu (3735m, 4hrs) where you will find two teahouses with sleeping facilities for about 10 people. The spire of Annapurna II soon appears. Beyond Chyako the path continues up to a ridgeline and a rather narrow, exposed stage. Fortunately it’s down next through a glade of silver birch on a slippery, muddy path. A large steel bridge waits at the bottom (about 5hrs into the walk). The Mruju Khola here drains from the well-hidden Lyapche Glacier of the Nemjung peaks. Massive moraines dominate the zone ahead. Here is the highest point of the day at 3950m. It’s quite a struggle to climb across not one but two of these obstacles before the welcoming sight ofKyang(3840m). After a short descent the ‘deluxe’ ACAP shelter here is attained, with water and one rather basic teahouse.",
                    "The sunrise view of Annapurna II from the shelter defies description, making even the most sleepless night fade into insignificance. LeavingKyang, the route contours towards the main canyon, where it drops dramatically on a path carved out of the brilliantly coloured, sheer-sided cliffs. Throw a backwards glance at Annapurna II and Lamjung, fantastically framed by the dark walls of the canyon. After 1hr is the western side valley of the Loha Khola, the domain of snow leopards. The path leads on to the isolated shrine of a deceased lama of the Khampa people, marked by a beautiful painting on the rock face (1½hrs from Kyang). Alongside the stone staircase here is a narrow defile, where the Phu Khola squeezes between weirdly shaped outcrops. The trail climbs up around a small bluff and descends to a side stream. Here the trail divides, the lower one keeping to the riverbank via a mani wall. The upper one climbs to a beautifully decorated old chorten and crosses a bridge to rejoin the main route in a few minutes.",
                    "About 3hrs from Kyang, sheer walls begin to close in on the trail. Oozing salt surrounds a strange outcrop and around a bluff is the most bizarre blood-red natural feature where red and white ‘corpuscles’ bleed from a gaping gash in the rock. Around the corner is another astonishing spectacle, a gigantic monolithic rock tower.",
                    "In thefolklore of Phu, great power has been attributed to this tremendous tower. It is said to depict the face of evil, where the spirits have been trapped. The river is also virtually trapped here, as it bubbles under this outcrop through a crack barely 1m wide.",
                    "Phu ’entry gate’ tower",
                    "The trail quickly runs away from this tower of evil into a small side gully, where the route climbs a seemingly impossible obstacle of sheer rock barring the way to Phu. It is steep, dramatic and rigorous up to the first kani gate. The narrow trail contours around the cliffs opposite an abandoned fort. Incredibly deep fissures in the eroded sandstone plunge down to the tortured river far below. Picturesque lines of larger chortens beside the now calm fresh clear waters of the Phu Khola herald the first astonishing view of Phu. High on the cliffs are long-abandoned hermit caves. Various brightly coloured mani walls grace the final stretch to the main suspension bridge that leads toPhucitadel and village (4080m).",
                    "Note that a new emergency shelter has now been built half way between Kyang and Phu.",
                    "One day is definitely desirable and two preferable, as there is so much to enjoy in the area. Apart from the Trashi Gompa, there are three options for extended walking from Phu – heading east, west or north.",
                    "The first settlements at Phu date back around 800 years; exploring involves ferreting about in narrow alleys, under low doorways and through tunnels that protect against the cold. Most of the citadel area can be accessed from the lane near the village monastery. Take time to climb up to the entrance way of the old fortified zone above, but be very careful of the structures that are near to collapse; beware of any dogs. The people of Phu spend their days spinning, weaving and yak or goat herding. Many migrate to the lowlands for the winter, when Phu is cut off from the outside world for several months, but some still spend the long, cold, dark winters here. There is a small seasonal school for about 20 children.",
                    "Phu has six basic lodges in the main area, as well as a shelter and ACAP camping site on the east bank. The Himalayan Border Lodge and the Karma Lodge were both temporarily closed at the time of the authors’ visit, but the brightly coloured unnamed lodge on the west side of the main citadel was open. Four beds in a converted animal shelter make a welcome place of respite above the cosy kitchen. The lockable toilet is up a very steep loose pathway above, so try to avoid a night visit or work out some other devious solution. There is currently electricity in Meta, Phu and Nar but nowhere else on the trek in the restricted zone.",
                    "Phu, seen across the monastery prayer flags",
                    "No one should miss the Trashi Gompa. The path to the monastery hillock goes around the south side of the citadel. Climb to the small Samdu Gompa in the village and head around on the main street, passing two lodges. Once around the Phu outcrop, there are two bridges leading over the stream to the monastery hill path. It’s a steep ascent of over 100m and takes roughly 30mins from Phu. Beyond the kani gate are 13 small chortens in a long row – a classic picture with Phu below. Beware of the guard dog whose first instinct is to be ferocious, but he is soon placated. On the first cloudy afternoon here the authors spotted a herd of blue sheep, perhaps seeking protection from prowling but elusive snow leopards.",
                    "Visitors should explore the hill in a clockwise direction where possible, following Buddhist conventions. For a fabulous all-round view, it’s best to head first along a dry ridge to the northern end of the hill. The valley to the north is dominated by Karjung Kang (Chako), a mountain similar to the Matterhorn in shape. Further north is Bhrikuti peak, named after the Nepalese princess who married King Strongsten Gampo, a major historic figure of Buddhist Tibet. Covering the monastery hill are numerous bright blue mani stones set in various banks and displays of devotion. Looking east, the great jumble of the Pangri Glacier dominates the panorama, while beyond lie mysterious peaks that no map has been able to name. Himlung is the highest named peak, but that is hidden behind the nearer barren hillside. To the south are three great massifs, the peaks and fluted walls of Nemjung, Chombi and the ridgeline of Kang Guru (6981m), glinting in the morning sunlight like a great icy whaleback.",

The main chamber is dedicated to Guru Rinpoche, but the gompa follows the Karma-pa sect of the Kagyu-pa school. Left of Guru Rinpoche is the Sakyamuni Buddha and Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future. Below is the curious idol of Guru Dragpo. To the right is a white Tara. Snellgrove referred to an image of the lion-headed dakini, Senge Dongma, but it’s not in evidence now. Buddha and another version of Guru Drakpo are on the right. Various thangkas and paintings adorn the walls, including a prominent Medicine Buddha and some fearsome Mahakalas. The reincarnate lamas of the Trashi Lhakhang are known as the Amchi, meaning revered healer or medicine man.",
                    "Above this chapel are more chambers. In the left-hand room is a Buddha icon with many books. The next chamber is very interesting, being the home of a large white Tara and the medical dispensary. Tibetan and more contemporary samples are displayed here. In the next chamber is another Sakyamuni Buddha with some stupas. The right side room is the Gonkhang and houses a red image of Tsapame. Females are not permitted to enter this chamber of horrors.",

                    "High above Phu is a private monastery from where rough, dangerously exposed tracks lead into the western valley. The views might open out to reveal the mysterious knot of peaks east of Phu – Himlung, Cheo Himal and Nemjung – that dominate the Larkya Himal of the Manaslu Trek.",
                    "The vast moraines of the Pangri Glacier completely dominate the view east from Phu. Most of the hike is rather ugly and frustrating, since the vistas only open out after much toil. There is no exact trail, but what there is begins across the main suspension bridge below Phu. Once past the ACAP camping shelter, keep generally close to the base of the hillside. Berberis and scrub struggle to survive here on the rocky moraines. With the hillside on your right, continue to climb relentlessly up and eventually around to the east. The authors did not follow this route, but their guide, who was the cook on a few Himlung expeditions, said the route eventually comes to the ridgeline of the moraine where the contorted rubble of the glacier and Himlung appear. North of the vast moraine complex is said to be a track to the Phu Goth herders’ shelter, but it looks a rather chaotic and difficult route to find.",
                    "The northern option is perhaps the more enticing. It follows the trail along the Layju Khola Valley, part of the route from Mustang via the Saribung (or Saibung) La and the Damodar Kund (Lake), briefly mentioned in the Damodar Kund Trek (end of Trek 5).",
                    "The trail to Damodar Kund north of Phu",
                    "From the two bridges below the Trashi Gompa, turn right. The trail climbs a little and contours around near a mani wall. It’s rather narrow and contours above a chorten before continuing around the base of the Trashi Gompa hillock. Care is needed here, since the trail crosses a couple of steep, loose sandy sections that lurch towards the edge. Just beyond the monastery hill is a water tank cover (about 30mins from Phu). Continue steadily and slowly uphill on to the moraine top and a small cairn. From here the view east is better than from Phu. Ratna Chuli is the long snowy peak, and south of it is Himlung (7126m).",
                    "The path contours up to a bluff of red and yellow rocks, (1hr). The climb ahead is tough, very steep and quite narrow. It takes at least 30mins to reach the high sandy plateau area. Looking back, Kang Guru and Lamjung are formidable. Looking west are amazingly ominous-looking contorted black rock walls that guard the peak of Pokarkang. To the north are the spire of Karjung Kang and the great faces of Bhrikuti Shail. Crossing the impossible-looking terrain below Bhrikuti Peak is the enticing-looking trail continuing north – an addictive prospect for those unavoidably attracted to the far horizons of the Trans Himalayas and Tibet.",
                    "It’s worth just crossing the plateau briefly here to peer down into the forlorn abyss of theLayju Khola canyon, peppered with oozing salt, organ-pipe features, strange outcrops – and a sensationally sheer drop. Do not get too close to the edge as it’s constantly falling away.",
                    "The estimated height here is 4400m, so don’t hang about or the altitude might begin to kick in. The return trip is surprisingly quick (around 1hr), but be careful on the steep, loose sections. With more time and clear weather, one might continue north to Nagoru and further, but beware of staying high for too long unless you are very well acclimatised.",
                    "It’s a long and surprisingly hard day to Meta, considering the altitude to be lost. Another option is to stay at the Nar Phedi monastery lodge, but check that it’s open.",
                    "Following the outward trail, be careful dropping down past the monolithic tower. Just after the junction where the alternative trails via the chorten or the mani wall join there is an alternative route on the west bank. A small bridge (almost 1½hrs from Phu) allows access. Cross the rocky areas of riverbank below fantastically sheer cliffs. About 15mins on is a frozen waterfall, where dripping daggers of ice dangle over an overhanging feature. In another 15mins the trail crosses another photogenic bridge to rejoin the main route at the Lama shrine.",
                    "The trail near Kyang",
                    "Kyangis about 3½hrs down from Phu. Be sure to take a break here, because the next section is a killer. The moraine crossed on the way into Kyang is now a formidable and exhausting obstacle; the next hour is hard. However, from Chyako (5hrs) there is some respite until the canyon beforeJunam. An hour from Chyako isChyk. From here the trail divides. The one above the meadows goes toMeta(see outward route above). The route for Nar Phedi goes down to the Chyk meadows. In a few minutes around the hillside the sandy path takes a dramatic turn, dropping through some weirdly shaped outcrops on a very unnerving path. At one point logs have been used to bridge a gaping lack of ground, and loose stones underfoot are the main difficulty. Luckily the descent is short to the two bridges that provide the only access to Nar Phedi, Nar and the Kang La. The attractive Chinese-looking cantilever bridge has been recently restored and makes a great picture. Just above the cataclysmic defile are the ruins of the ancient fortress of Zampo Cho Dzong (the sacred fort of the bridge).",
                    "The chasm below the bridges is phenomenally deep and barely 10m across.Nar Phediand its extraordinary new red monastery are just uphill, but the path is cruel at this late stage of the day. The new monastery at Nar Phedi is funded from overseas and now has a functioning lodge for trekkers and guests.",
                    "Start early fromMeta(orNar Phedi) to take advantage of the morning calm, as the wind can be ferocious on this hillside. If staying in Meta, head down to the bridges on the signed path.",
                    "Those with bags of energy should divert from the two bridges on the path south to the ancient, virtually abandonedmonastery of Yunkar(Yung Kar Lhacho) and its very stylish large chorten. The name suggests some historic connection with the Bon people of Tibet, but today it’s mostly all locked up. This detour might take 30mins; be aware that the narrow path climbs back up to the two bridges rather steeply.",
                    "The first part of the climb to Nar is steep and then becomes rocky underfoot as it zigzags up to the first small chorten (1hr from the bridges). About 15mins later is a small kani gateway and from here the less steep meadow offers some respite. The teahouse of Gulung is ahead, but water is not guaranteed. Up to the next small chorten the way is steep; however, the view north to the Tiri La Valley is fantastic.",

                    "On this trail make way for the ponies that keep Nar supplied with firewood, as there is only dried dung for fuel above Nar Phedi. After another small chorten, the muddy trail is almost level as it sweeps around the hillside with an evil drop. About 4hrs from Meta is the fourth small chorten; soon after the trail heads into a walled zone. The North Face of Pisang Peak dominates the route, with its maze of odd-looking pyramid-structured rock bands. Outcrops of boulders accompany the trail to the photogenic line of chortens that are watched over by Kang Guru, which bears more than a passing resemblance to a mirror image of Mont Blanc at this point. From here it’s an easy amble toNar(4110m) around the hillside. A lower path heads into the heart of the village, while the other path leads directly to the lodges.",
                    "Before the trail from Koto was cut about 20 years ago, theKang Lawas the main way into Nar. Snellgrove used the pass during his 1956 explorations of the area. According to a teacher from Tal who spent a year in Nar recently, the hair-raising ancient trail from Koto was passable only during times of low water, when temporary log bridges were in use. These were then taken to higher, safer spots above the riverbank and stored until the next season of low water.",

There is a large colourful chorten near the mani wall and big prayer wheel. The local people will be busy weaving and spinning wool for much of the day. Buckwheat, barley and potatoes are the main crops. Nar has six good lodges (Shanti, Laxmi, Nar Guest House, Kangla Lodge and Hotel Diki Ling), although only one or two might be open at any time. A seventh is called Hotel Karma, set in a large mansion house that isn’t sure if it is really open for business. There is a hydroelectrict plant in Nar which is now running again after a short closure.",

                    "There are also four small monasteries, once of the Nyingma-pa order, but the Karma-pa lamas are also revered here. A fifth monastery is under construction. The one in the village was not open, but a squint through the window revealed an eight-armed Buddha and Guru Rinpoche. The monastery near the lodges is also closed and there’s no hope of seeing inside. The monastery below the village is also closed, but it has some penetrating eyes on its top turret. The monastery well below the village in the meadows is also closed, but through various dusty windows idols of the main protecting images, Yamantaka and Mahakala, along with six central icons, two stupas and an impressive Sakyamuni Buddha flanked by his two disciples can be seen. The school operates for about six months, but many children are sent to Buddhist monasteries across Nepal and even as far as India.",
                    "With only a short trek to Meta to follow, it’s definitely worth getting up early to explore Nar again and the valley west before departing down that big hill. Heading towards theKang La Phedimeadows are a series of chortens about 15mins from Nar. The second square set of chortens house water-driven prayer wheels. The stream is the village water source; it’s a long slog to get water. Climb up past three chortens near the defunct hydro plant to a viewpoint displaying Pisang, Kang Guru, Chombi and Nemjung. Chulu Far East is visible from the other meadows. The trail to Kang La Phedi appears to be a steady, gentle but no doubt exhausting climb.",
                    "Before leavingNar, it might be worthwhile to climb the small hills east of the lodges for an uninterrupted view down. The trek down is accomplished with a lot less effort, but loose sections are waiting to catch you out occasionally. Be careful! Views are dominated by the West Face of Kang Guru.",
                    "This stage is a long walk down, but surprisingly many small ups are encountered all day long. However, the return to warmer climes, masses more oxygen and the thought of the first shower in a week can aid the pace. By the beginning of April, the potentially lethal snow chutes on the path should have been cleared by ACAP staff for the benefit of long trains of goods-laden ponies.",
                    "Crossing the Marsyangdi bridge and arriving back on the main trail is like spinning out of orbit and suddenly landing back on Planet Earth. At the checkpost life continues as before, with a steady stream of afternoon trekkers registering their progress on the Annapurna Circuit.

Unless you are exceedingly well acclimatised it is not recommended to access Nar from Ngawal-Manang side owing to the extreme altitude gain (1600m) over the Kang La and the very steep ascent towards the end. The climb involves an ascent of around 1200m from Nar to the Kang La, followed by a very steep and often icy descent at the start to Ngawal over 1600m lower down.",
                    "Crossing from Nar to Ngawal is possible in one long day of 11hrs. Nar to Kang La Phedi is an ascent of around 450m (2½–3hrs); for most of the way the excellent trail is not unduly steep. The jagged walls of the Yungregang Ridge, which runs from Pisang Peak, dominate the hike. Looking back impressive views appear of nearby Kangaru Himal and, in the distance, Manaslu. At Phedi there are two mini teahouses and a very basic shelter, but camping with a fully equipped crew will make the whole project much more pleasant.",
                    "From Kang La Phedi to Ngawal takes 7–8 hrs. Not far after Phedi there is a big bridge to cross followed by a climb all the way on to the pass. The trail is excellent and well used. (If you are in any doubt about coping with the altitude gain, you can hire a horse in Nar for Rs7000 to accompany you to the pass just in case it is needed.) The views back get better and better the higher you climb. Besides Kangaru Himal there are now also views towards Himlung Himal. The trail heads up towards the icy ramparts of Chulu Far East and the rocky flanks of the Kangla Himal. Just before you reach the pass there is a small lake on your left. Circle around it and climb the last section to the pass, which is decorated by prayer flags and a sign post saying ‘congratulations’ – and the name and height of the pass.",
                    "When getting over the final ridge the climb is rewarded by a breathtaking view towards Gangapurna and the Annapurnas, and possibly Macchapuchhare. Far below, the airstrip of Humde can be spotted.",
                    "The descent is long and starts with an exposed, rather dangerous section. Plan lunch at the pass if there is enough room, otherwise at the bottom of the steep section. To the far right Tilicho Peak can be spotted.",
                    "The trail is good and flatter after lunch, but another steep section follows all the way down to Ngawal. Luxury lodges are a welcome sign in Ngawal and a beer is a well ‐deserved treat.",

                    "These two short but tough treks will be a revelation to frequent Annapurna region explorers. Mardi Himal (5600m) is the rocky peak that guards the southwest flank of Machhapuchhre; it is also the eastern guardian of the Annapurna Sanctuary–Modi Khola ‘entry gate’. The approaches to Mardi Himal are along the airy, lofty ridges that run north of Pokhara. Panoramic views from the ridges are magnificent: vistas west to Dhaulagiri and Churen Himal and east to Annapurna II, Lamjung, Himalchuli and Baudha. The fantastic rock triangle of Machhapuchhre completely dominates other views, but look south for uninterrupted panoramas of dazzling, blue-rinsed ridges.",
                    "Because both the ridge trails climb quickly, the main risk on these sometimes-exposed belvederes is of altitude sickness. Scrambling around Mardi Himal Base Camp needs care: remember it’s a trek, not a climb! Currently the trek is suitable for camping, because the daily marches can be varied to suit the conditions and acclimatisation levels. Some rustic lodges have been developed on the Mardi Himal option as more trekkers discover these pristine routes. So far not enough bed space exists in the lodges in high season. Check with the Pokhara trekking agencies. The two routes and the terrain crossed can be observed from Sarangkot Hill near Pokhara. A guide who knows the way intimately is needed for both routes.",
                    "Currently the typical cost of a fully inclusive trek to either Mardi Himal or Machhapuchhre Korchon is US$55 for the lodge option on Mardi Himal, or US$70–80 per day for camping. This will include guide, cook, porters, all camping equipment and full board food on trek. Permits, drinks and personal equipment will be extra.",
                    "Water supplies on this high ridge are often an issue, depending on the season, so you may not necessarily have a lot of choice of camp location. The following information is given only in outline, with estimated altitudes and timings.",
                    "Take transport from Pokhara toDhampus Phedi(or Dhampus). It’s a classic walk with variety and memorable views of the ‘Fishtail’ peak. After climbing up the hill or taking a jeep to Dhampus, the path climbs along the ridge to good lodges atPothana(1890m). It’s better to stay near Pothana if camping, as Deurali has few flat camping areas.",
                    "BeyondDeurali(2100m), the trail leaves the busy route to Landruk and begins the long, wild climb along the Kali Danda Ridge. Fleeting views of the mountains ratchet up the anticipation of getting closer to Machhapuchhre. This cool forest stage is magical and strangely quiet: rhododendron and magnolia, larch and moss-covered, decaying vegetation are encountered. Ancient gnarled trunks host dripping, wispy lichens. There is apparently a functioning rustic forest lodge atKokar(about 3050m).",
                    "There are few landmarks along this route, the domain of woodcutters, herders, monkeys and very few foreign trekkers. The trail continues to climb in varying degrees of steepness; the path, being rarely used, is not always good. The normal overnight stop is at a place calledLow Campwith a basic lodge (about 3050m). Another intermediate and quite good lodge is also found further up (1–2hrs) atBadal.",
                    "On the trail",
                    "Breaking free of the dense forest, the route climbs steadily upwards into the high pastures and open moorland. Assuming the clouds keep at bay, the closer you get to the Fishtail, the more amazing its towering buttresses become. The trail (such as it is) makes a considerable height gain. En route isBadal, a good lunch break. How long the walk takes will depend on the ability of the group and acclimatisation. Another small rudimentary lodge is found atHigh Camp(about 3900m).",
                    "Base Camp(4500m) is the high point of the trek in all senses, as the route climbs to within a whisker of the great rocky outlier of Mardi Himal (5553m). The effects of altitude need to be remembered, as going too high is always a temptation on these exciting days.",
                    "The return march to Pokhara is generally the same way toPothana, then on to eitherDhampus/Dhampus Phedior Australian Camp/Khare. However, according to trekking agent and guide KB Nembang, who has years of experience in Pokhara and beyond, a difficult route off the ridge goes down east into the Susel/Mardi Khola Valley. Check in detail about this if you want to vary the return.",
                    "A variation on the Mardi Himal trek, this route is along a ridge further east, offering equally awe-inspiring panoramic views. With the Mardi Himal ridge blocking the mountains to the west, you can enjoy the ‘eastern light’ and the peaks of Annapurna IV and II and Lamjung. Himalchuli and distant Ganesh might show their shining faces. Only an outline itinerary is shown below, since the authors have not done this route.",
                    "From Mardi Pul (or Ribban), the first day involves a climb up the steep ridge, possibly as far asLalka, but the availability of water, an important factor on the whole route, will determine the exact camping place.",
                    "The trekking must be tough, as the trail continues to ascend the ridge to Odane. Occasionally shade is on offer, with some forest cover. Rhododendrons bloom in spring and woodcutters shelter in isolated kharkas.Odane Hill(2515m) is the usual camp, making it a half-day march.",
                    "The next day, the trail continues mostly uphill; it’s that sort of trek when you are heading for Machhapuchhre. At least there are great views when you leave the cover of the forest. Owing to the altitude gain, you need to stop inKumai Danda(3245m).",
                    "Although in distance it’s not far, you will soon be reminded of the height gain to be made toKorchon(3680m). Even if you are fit, remember to go slowly for the sake of your acclimatisation. With more open pasture to cross, the views distract you from looking at your feet all day. From Korchon you can either return the same way or attempt the trail west down to the Mardi Khola via Naudhoke, but make sure your guide knows this trail. Most will continue on to Base Camp.",
                    "Given a clear dawn, it will be hard to get moving on this day. You can’t get much better panoramic viewpoints in Nepal for sunrise on the peaks, floating above endless valleys, often shrouded in mist. With theSouth Base Camplocated at 4120m, you need to take it very steadily along the ridgeline. With trails rarely used, don’t expect the ground underfoot to be as forgiving as on a regular route. At the South Base Camp you are no more than 5–6km from the sheer unconquered South Face of Machhapuchhre. The summit gods gaze down at you from a vertical drop of over 2800m (9180ft).",
                    "Machhapuchhre at sunset",
                    "There is a route marked on the maps between South Base Camp and the West Base Camp, but taking this means a colossal descent and ascent that is quite impossible – so don’t expect any trekking agency to plan this one. From Mardi Himal South Base Camp you have to retreat down toKorchon. It is apparently possible to leave the ridgeline and descend to the Seti Khola Valley and end the walking inGhachok(1260m) for an array of second-class transport options to Pokhara. The descent is much quicker, but watch those knees. Otherwise retrace your route from Korchon to Mardi Pul."

All offered great views of the Annapurnas and kept to relatively low altitudes, making for easier, stress-free hiking. A route along the ridges from Pokhara to Begnas Tal became known as the Royal Trek. Being only 3–4 days in duration, it proved very popular with trekkers who wanted a taste of Nepal’s mountain attractions without needing to be excessively fit.",

Siklis is a major Gurung village, nestling on a high meadow, dominated by the slumbering giant of Lamjung peak. These days few trekkers venture to Siklis; those who do, however, have reported that it is still a tranquil place to visit.",
                    "Both routes start or finish in the resort lake area of Begnas Tal, about 15km east of Pokhara, on a road that leaves the main Kathmandu highway at km10. These days better hotels have been developed to cater for the increasing numbers of foreign, Nepalese and Indian tourists.",

Then the trek encompassed all the traditional features typical of a moderate hike in the farming countryside: picturesque rounded ochre and red-coloured houses, undisturbed forests singing with cicadas, grubby children rushing to greet the strangers and women in brightly coloured saris washing clothes, while the men pondered on the future of the country…",

That said, the views have not changed; on a clear day the Himalayan giants on display include Machhapuchhre, Annapurna IV, Annapurna II and Lamjung. Allow three days for a gentle stroll along this ridgetop, and check whether you still need to take a tent or if homestays have developed.",
                    "For a region so close to Pokhara, this trek illustrates well the typical, rural farming life of the hills. Untouched rhododendron forests and mountain views of Machhapuchhre, Annapurna IV, Annapurna II and Lamjung add to the mix. Camping was the only option but Dhiprang and Siklis have lodges. Check with trekking agencies in Pokhara in case homestays are opening elsewhere. Note that you will need the usual TIMS and ACAP permits for this area. Only an outline itinerary is provided, as few people do this route now.",

It’s a leisurely introduction to the village life of the Annapurna foothills.",

                    "The path slips and slides up to theBayule Danda(2900m), the high point of the trek. The descent is much the same. Some trekkers make an intermediate camp after the forest near Chipli orKhilang, allowing for a half-day hike through Parche toSiklis(1980m). Siklis is surrounded by rich farmland and the view of Lamjung Himal is pretty impressive. Before leaving, most trekkers explore the meadows and view Lamjung from a closer hillock north of the village. There are three or four lodges here now.",

New routes (and dirt roads) are being rapidly developed in this area, destined for a different type of visitor. Through homestay programmes, modest trekking is being combined with cultural interaction, eco-tourism and village development. Hikers looking for a more authentic, intimate experience of traditional rural Nepal will want to check out these new routes. Homestays with local families are being encouraged in order to spread the visitor’s dollars into areas where, until now, only subsistence agriculture has sustained the way of life.",

Bizarrely this latest, almost fashionable, initiative is a kind of reinvention of the ‘good old days’ of early trekking 40 years ago. Note also that when you ‘travel back in time’ you can’t expect the level of luxury and standard of toilets that modern lodges provide on the main trails. These trails offer fine scenery, tranquillity and equally spectacular views but are not yet ideal for independent trekking; the trails are not marked, so taking a guide with specialist knowledge, and porter, is vital.",

                    "The star attraction, apart from the superb ambience, is thenew climbing wall. Two local young men have been trained in professional rock climbing by Tyler Cline, a rock climber from Salt Lake City, who spent six months living in Puranokot village, teaching safety and techniques. The 100m-high wall utilises the dramatic cliff face near the village.",
                    "People in Puranokot call themselves the Duras, a mongoloid group from the Dura Danda Ridge, but there are also Gurungs.",
                    "LeavingPuranokot, the route descends along the wooded ridges and terraced ricefields toLamjung DurbarforBesisahar(760m). Lamjung Durbar is an intact Newari-style substantial former fiefdom palace.",
                    "Off the road north from Dumre to Besisahar is the traditional hill village of Chowk Chisopani, accessed by jeep from Kalimati (about 22km from Dumre) or 2hrs’ walk uphill. It is one of those unusual places where Newari people have migrated to the hills from their ancestral home in the Kathmandu Valley. The village is also home to Gurung, Chhetri and Magar people. The locality offers panoramic views. Visitors could also overnight in Bandipur, a beautiful hill town near Dumre, en route to Chowk Chisopani.",
                    "The following description should enable trekkers to take a day walk here, but for most visitors having a guide and porter is essential across this entire region, both for safety and to avoid getting utterly lost.",
                    "From the west side of centralKalimatithere is a dirt road to Chowk Chisopani, or take the steep path from the north end. Following the dirt road is easier. The ‘road’ loops up to a banyan and pipal tree grove. Beyond the trees there is a junction (30mins). Go left uphill into a woody glade where monkeys abound. Continue to some houses, taking the old path to cut the road corners. About 1hr from Kalimati is a stupa with two white chortens. From here take the path up left, passing traditional rural houses before crossing the dirt road. Ahead soon is a white building, the post office, reached in about 1½hrs from Kalimati.Chowk Chisopani(1000m) is a spread-out village. To reach the upper area of the village take the small path up a narrow gully from the right side of the post office. A shop, a large school and two temples (devoted to Laxshmi, Narayan and Shiva), are located 20–30mins uphill.",
                    "Chowk Chisopani village",
                    "Apart from the utterly untouched rural environment of the village, the main attraction on a clear day is the stunning panorama that spans almost 360° from the school and nearby. The arc, from east to west, includes Baudha, Himalchuli, Ngadi Chuli and Manaslu, as well as Lamjung to Annapurna South. Below are the lush green hillsides of the Middle Hills. A new, more comfortable project is being developed on the north side of the village to link Bandipur with the area. Check the status of accommodation before planning an overnight stay.",
                    "The family of Sohan Shrestha own a sizeabletraditional Newari housenear the temples, with typical mud-plastered walls and pleasing wood-carved windows and doorways. There are plans for it to become a homestay in the future. For more details see updates onwww.expeditionworld.comor contact Sohan Shrestha at sohan_kgh@hotmail.com. A Gurung family may also be able to provide accommodation soon.",
                    "From Chowk Chisopani there are three alternative trails to Paundi, Sundar Bazaar or Chanapata/Okhlepani.",
                    "From the northeast end of the school look for a pipal tree to find the trail down to Paundi and Sundar. The path descends steeply and crosses a small ‘tractor’ track (5–10mins). Continue on the path down to a path intersection. Going left here leads toSundar Bazaar(about 3hrs). A guide is vital for this route. From Sundar Bazaar erratic transport should be available to Khatri Thanti and beyond towards Chanapata or Okhlepani. However, you might end up walking, so be prepared, taking water and snacks.",
                    "The trail toPaundibasically always heads straight down from this intersection on the stone Gurung staircase. It’s a lonely, almost-disused route but eventually comes down to various farms after 1hr. Cross a dirt road and go down to the Paundi Khola. Head right along the riverbed to find the main Besisahar road and go left for the bus stop or village over the steel bridge (1½hrs).",
                    "A much better and more direct link to the Puranokot area is to take a trail from the temple area of Chowk Chisopani via Bayapani and Kuncha.",
                    "The authors have not walked this route so please check details locally. Description kindly supplied by Jane Morgan.",
                    "From the temple at Chowk Chisopani take a left path and follow a dirt road/track with pleasant rural views. AtBayapaniask for a room and food at a shop. There is a private room up some precarious steps but expect only ‘a bird bath’. There is often a shortage of water but it is quite adequate for one night.",
                    "From Bayapani village the route goes up two flights of steps towards the hospital and then turns right through forest (locals will show you the way). It may be slippery for a while. Where the jeep road goes left uphill, take the grass path to the right, passing some houses. Walk around some terraces, then steps. A few yards down, go left into terraces, and right down a stony track. Keep going down more steps until you get to Kuncha. It may be possible to stay with a family near the water tap.",
                    "Ask the locals to put you on the right track. From Kuncha follow a dirt road with beguiling rural views toBhagira. By the first lot of houses in Bhagira take a track with steps on the right into tranquil forest. A steep descent follows, and after about an hour the route crosses the often-dry river atKaoiralot. If you want hot noodles and a cup of tea, the lady on the left may be able to oblige. Follow a dirt road which has no shade.Okhlepaniis not the most attractive place to stay, so walk on to Chanapata where there are better facilities. Continue along the dirt road for about 40 minutes until you see some steps to your left. If you go right at this junction and past a school, you have gone the wrong way. It’s a rather gruelling hike up if it is hot. InChanapatathe first house on the right, next to the water tap and with a material shop underneath, takes hikers (from Rs250). The mountain views here, and just a little higher up the road, are fabulous.",
                    "To avoid getting lost on the trails it’s best to follow the very quiet dirt road to the picturesque village ofTurlung. The views are, again, awesome, with Puranokot in the distance to the right. After 40 minutes’ walk there is a distinctive fork in the road; go left for Thuloswanra (the right-hand fork will take you to Puranokot). Continue on the dirt road, descending for about an hour to a school on your left. Take the steps downhill to arive atThuloswanra, also known as Sundure.",
                    "It is recommended to begin this trekking route at Ramgha and work your way across the middle hills of the Lamjung district to Besisahar. From Pokhara and Begnas Tal, a series of new rough roads run over the Sarka Bhanjyang Pass to the Midim Khola and east through Karputar. Allow 6–7hrs for the drive to Ramgha (530m).",
                    "From the humid lowlands of the Midim Valley, the trail heads up through terraced hillsides toSamibhanjyang, a small saddle.",
                    "Climbing more, the route reaches the hilltop location ofTandrangkotand then continues toNeta(1100m).",
                    "The complex series of ridges and valleys that typify the area are accessed fairly easily from Neta village as the trail leads on toThuloswanra(1600m). Although a historical site, little remains of its past glories, but the views of the mountains are magnificent.",
                    "On a clear day, the walking is dominated by the Himalayas to the north – Annapurna II and the great whaleback of Lamjung are always prominent. SeeTrek 12for outline details of the route.",
                    "Local homestay children",
                    "Before leavingPuranokot(1750m), there is plenty of time to try your hand on the climbing wall. SeeTrek 12for details of the route.",
                    "Traditional village",
                    "Last but not least, this easy-to-moderate trek shows off the Gurung culture and some of the least-visited regions below Annapurna II and Lamjung. Villages like Bhujung have rarely been heard of – until now. This trek offers a glimpse into traditional hill country life, where little-known ethnic peoples other than Gurungs are found. The trek utilises homestay accommodation.",
                    "Because the ACAP area is entered you need to obtain the TIMS and ACAP Conservation Area permits in advance. Since these new areas are not used to trekkers, taking a guide from the Pokhara or Lamjung region is essential. The authors have not done this route, so timings are estimated.",
                    "The trek starts east of Pokhara at Thumsikot/Gumle Bazaar. Buses and jeeps take roughly 2hrs, departing normally four times daily from Ranipauwa in Pokhara between 7am and 3pm.",
                    "After crossing the Madi Khola fromGumle Bazaar, the route climbs to Gahate and on toNagidhar(1260m) for the first night, with tantalising views.",
                    "On the second day it’s necessary to descend to the Rudi Khola Valley and climb up along the ridge to the village ofPasagaon(1652m), with its Buddhist kani and monastery.",
                    "The third morning involves a climb through delightful forest to 2100m. Between here and Bhujung is the valley of the Midim Khola, which needs to be crossed.Bhujung(1625m) is located above the valley and is reached by a typical Gurung stone staircase trail. This aesthetically pleasing traditional village is currently notable as being the largest Gurung village in Nepal. Electricity has arrived here and homestays are available.",
                    "Different ethnic groups along the trail",
                    "Reached by a long, remote and rugged trail from Bhujung is theholy lake of Dudh Pokhari(4600m, meaning ‘milky lake’), where Shiva and Parvati reputedly bathed. This route continues over the Namun La (4850m) to Timang.",
                    "FromBhujungthe trail heads to Ghalegaon, once the dominant fiefdom of the region. Before Nayan there are no facilities; the trek is through isolated country. Later there is a side trail to Ghan Pokhara, a hilltop village with panoramic views.Ghalegaon(2092m), a beautiful Gurung settlement, is the overnight stop, making this a relatively short day. Ghalegaon can also be reached by a dirt track from Besisahar in 3–4hrs.",
                    "From here the designated route descends to Khudi.This trail also leads to a junction giving access to Baglungpani and the trekking area described below.The path to Khudi heads to Balamchaur, initially through uninhabited forest, and on toSimpani, the village of temples, used by devotees of a local deity, Thani Mai, as well as by followers of Ganesh, Krishna and his consort Radha, and Mahadev. FromKhudi(790m) trekkers can join the main Annapurna Circuit trail (Trek 1) or head south for Dumre, Pokhara, Chitwan or Kathmandu.",

From Begnas Tal, the route crosses the low saddle of Sarka Bhanjyang to Karputar and goes along the Midim Khola Valley to Nalma Phedi. An unrelenting climb follows up to Baglungpani (1595m), where there is a lodge. Descent is via the Bhalam (Boran) Khola to Khudi.

                    "The planned itinerary uses existing hill farm trails from the town of Beni in the lower Kali Gandaki Valley. From Beni the trail keeps high above the valley of the Raughat Khola, generally heading northwest above Galeshwar. The main villages along the southwest side of the river are Syalikhet, Patelekhet and Thirbang. Another trail on the northeast side of the valley also leads via Dagnam to a junction above Thirbang, where the trails converge. From here in the increasingly confined valley the route goes to Dhar, the last major settlement. Above Dhar the route uses herders’ tracks and trails through Panela to the tree line near Phedi. Continuing northwards, the trail follows the Thulo Khola into the ‘sanctuary’ area of glaciers that tumble from the south face of Dhaulagiri.",
                    "The return route is much the same, with the choice of trails near Thirbang mentioned above. Another option being explored lies to the east of the Thulo Khola, following the ridge line at around 3000m down to the settlement of Chimkhola. This ridge also continues north to the peak of Sarbang Dhuri, where a wild herders’ route eventually descends to the Kali Gandaki valley near Lete. For the time being this route is only in the initial stages of planning. Anyone interested in pioneering these routes should consult the Dhaulagiri Circuit (1:90,000) map published by Himalayan Map House (Map NS501)."
