          "‘Josh assured me that no matter the size or weight of the dress we would find a way to get it up to the mountain. What we didn’t anticipate was being barefoot, in the snow, during the ceremony.’",
          "In June this year, Susannah and Joshua Beckett were married at Birendra Lake, near Sama Gaun on the Manaslu Circuit and Tsum Valley Trek. Opting out of a big wedding in Canada, where the couple is from, Susannah and Joshua nevertheless wanted to have a day they would remember for the rest of their lives.",
          "The bride was stunning in a backless traditional white dress, while the groom looked like the classic bridegroom in his black suit. What the stunning photographs don’t show, however, is how the bride had to get into her dress behind a stone hut while trying hard not to step in yak dung or how they are both shoeless (Or hiking bootless) in many of the pictures!",
          "While tourists do get married in Nepal not many options to do so during a 22-day trek. So how did this idea come about?‘We live in Whitehorse Yukon which is in the northern part of Canada and quite mountainous.",
          "We love the mountains and spend almost every weekend in the Yukon mountains. What is great about Nepal is with teahouse treks you can have a long trek without having to worry about carrying food for the entire journey.",
          "We have both been to Nepal together before, and Josh has been on another occasion too.’",
          "‘I wanted to have a big wedding with friends and family but Josh had the idea to elope! First, we were going to get married on a mountain in the Yukon but the logistics of it didn’t work so well, so we thought we would go to Iceland. In the end, however, the beauty of Nepal won out.",
          "We both love being in the mountains so much it was an easy choice to go to Nepal once we had decided to elope and get married on a mountain somewhere. And it really didn’t take long to organize, because we had been to Nepal before and knew what we were getting into.",
          "In fact, it was much easier to arrange than organizing a traditional wedding in Canada,’ Susannah.",
          "Having done their research, the couple met someone who had used Magical Nepal for their trek, and on that recommendation, we got in touch.",
          "With Magical Nepal being very helpful, the decision to go with them was easy to make. ‘Magical Nepal was amazing in helping us organize our wedding trek in Manaslu Circuit. They even sent a photographer at no extra charge.",
          "Originally we thought of doing our own photography with a tripod but instead, we have stunning professional photographs taken by Jaya Photography from Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam to remind us of this time,’ Josh.",
          "‘On the day we were both really excited, it was a beautiful location with amazing mountains all around us and we were marrying the person we love.",
          "Our guide, Deepak, was the one who suggested the spot we got married at, he even picked Susannah a bouquet of wildflowers on the way to the location. By chance, we did actually have ‘guests’ at our wedding – another couple from Canada we had met earlier along the trail – who arrived just as Susannah was walking down the ‘aisle’.",
          "They even rescued Susannah’s dress when it got caught in a bush! The second group of ‘guests’ arrived with their guides, who were extremely excited to see us and asked if they could have a photograph taken with us. The guides picked some wildflowers for both of us and placed Khatas around our necks as a symbol of happiness. This was an amazing gesture and we have the Khatas hanging on our wall at home,’ Josh.",
          "‘As for celebrating… we did take a bottle of champagne with us but in the end, we didn’t drink it until the last day of the trip when we shared it with our guide, Deepak, the photographer, Jaya, and the two porters, Santos and Rohan.",
          "On the wedding day itself, we had a three-hour hike to the wedding location, spent a couple of hours for the ceremony and photographs then made our way back to Sama Goan. At that point, I realized I had left our phones and some other things at the wedding location so I had to sprint as fast as possible back up the mountain.",
          "So by the time I did that and got back, there was just time for a quick meal and to send a few messages to family and friends before going to sleep. Hence keeping the champagne for the last day!’ Josh.",
          "Would the happy couple recommend getting married on a mountain in Nepal to others?‘It wasn’t your traditional style wedding. For example, Josh hadn’t showered in 11 days! My hair and makeup weren’t done and I had to dodge piles of dung while walking down the “aisle”.",
          "But, if there are others out there who love being in the mountains as much as us and don’t mind a very non-traditional wedding with no friends or family present then I would say do it as it was an amazing experience. We wrote our vows, which we exchanged along with rings.",
          "It was perfect. Having a backdrop for our wedding like we did was amazing and we will never forget it,’ Susannah."

          "But bringing a wedding and trek together is a mammoth task! For example, every couple wants good photographs to remember their special day and Magical Nepal made sure of that…",
          "‘I started my career as a wedding photographer in 2010 and have been to many countries taking photos for wedding couples. Before my Nepal trip, I had been to Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, India, and some European countries for work,’ states Jaya, the photographer who took the beautiful pictures for the wedding of Susannah and Joshua Beckett.",
          "‘I accepted this invitation by Magical Nepal because I thought I might never have a second chance for such a special project again. I also wanted to challenge myself. Although I have been to many remote regions and some smaller mountains in Vietnam I had never been to such a place as Manaslu.",
          "I realized the trek would be difficult for me so I prepared, building my stamina, for a whole month before coming to Nepal.’",
          "Wondering how someone from Vietnam which is mainly hot coped with the cold and mountainous trails, we asked Jaya if he found things difficult during this trip. ‘Certainly, there were many things which I could not even imagine – the beauty of the countryside, the cold, and the long distances traveled by foot.",
          "Since Susannah and Joshua are very experienced trekkers, I had a hard time keeping up with them. However, this trip will forever be a special memory for me. The stunning Himalayan ranges, the starry skies, and the endless cold nights. There were no necessities, only footsteps, deep breaths, and genuine realization of life.",
          "The trip has triggered nostalgic emotions in me. It was about a secluded world I used to have back in the days when the Internet was not even a thing. Emotions are still so vivid and real every time I close my eyes and reminisce about the trip.",
          "Overall, it was a bold decision for me to leave my busy work schedule with tons of unanswered emails and lots of deadlines behind. I embarked on a surreal journey. Thank you Magical Nepal for the opportunity.’",
          "And some final words on this epic adventure wedding from Pradeep Guragain, co-founder of Magical Nepal. ‘I have received lots of queries for trekking but none of them was quite as special as the one I got from Susannah and Joshua. They wanted to get married in the mountains during their trek.",
          "So without much hesitation, I had a nice offer for them: a professional photographer to capture their once-in-a-lifetime event, provided free by Magical Nepal. I approached some Nepali photographers to undertake this trip, but I also approached Jaya who I had met back in 2017 on a road trip across Vietnam.",
          "Jaya replied positively, and we soon arranged the schedule. During my years working as a trekking operator, this was the very first time I organized a special trek like this. It was challenging but fun at the same time. In the end, we are very happy with the outcome of the project.",
          "We would like to thank Jaya and our guide Deepak who did an excellent job being not only the coordinator but also the photographer’s assistant. Thank you, Deepak and the rest of the crew. And a special thanks must go to Susannah and Joshua Beckett for entrusting their special day to Magical Nepal.’ Pradeep."

Sharp 8:00 AM we left the station. With a small toilet break in the middle, we continued our journey to Arughat.

This incredible ancient practice is now available to trekkers.",

          "During the mid monsoon my friend and I, we went there. We started our trip on 25th of July 2015. Instead of regular trekking, it was a road trip on a motorbike. Also was a very short trip, we finished entire trip, i.e. Kathmandu – Lo Manthang – Kathmandu in a single week. I was surprised to saw despite of the devastating earthquake, Upper Mustang had remained totally intact.",
          "Yes, it was excellent for the trek. In reality, trekkers’ flow was high; we encountered with few big size groups on their way up. Initially, we had a plan to trek Damodar Kunda as well; as a part of this hike, tent and mattress were included in our backpack. However, the plan was changed, and we decided not to hike Damodar Kunda. We leave our tent and mattress in the village of Jomsom. Jomsom, a district headquarter of Mustang.",
          "From Kathmandu to Pokhara, everything was perfect so far. The plan was to reach Beni same day starting from Kathmandu. As monsoon was doing its work, suddenly black clouds dominate the northern sky of Pokhara and we decide not to drive to Beni.",
          "On the very first day of the road trip, we stayed in Pokhara. Next morning we started pretty early, and we continued our journey to Kagbeni. There were few landslides, and peoples were busy renovating the road. It was slightly diverted in a few places, next to the bank of Kali Gandaki River. Personally, I don’t recommend going through road to Jomsom; it could be far better with the flight.",
          "We stopped in the Ghasa for lunch. Rupche Waterfall, a big obstacle for the bike and jeeps. It was so big that it was impossible to drive through the waterfall. We paid USD 8 for the five locals to carry the bike to the next side and that works. Because of this delay, we couldn’t reach Jomsom in time. And we again changed the plan, overnight stay in Jomsom instead of Kagbeni.",

          "Our aim was to reach Lo Manthang at any cost. So we took his suggestion very lightly and continued our journey toward the last forbidden kingdom. It was a long day, as we had reached Lo Manthang late afternoon, around 6:00 PM. “Lotus Holiday Inn”, it was a teahouse in Lo Manthang recommended by the owner of the hotel in Samar.",
          "That was a very nice hotel, and I also recommend that to anyone. We were so tired, at the dinner time we encountered a german couple. Same like us, it was their first day in Lo. They shared their plan and invite them to join. Two hippies were adopted in Lo Manthang?",
          "Next morning we went to explore three major monasteries of the village. There was a huge clay fence, circling the entire village. According to the hotel owner before it wasn’t allowed to build the house outside of the fence. But with increasing population, they started building houses outside the boundary of clay fence. Hotel owner, accompanied us for the trip to the monastery and described the entire historical aspects at his best.",

Currently, he was leading the team of painters, their mission was to renovate the painting inside the monasteries. It was a long project and the Italian guy he speaks very fluent Nepali and Local Language as well.",
          "Next day horses were arranged for a round trip to Choser from Lo. We paid USD 18 for each horse and it was an eight hour trip. We explored Choser Cave and two other monasteries near by. Same day we drive back to Samar.",
          "From Samar we started very early in the morning, for lunch we stopped in Ghasa again. Probably we were familiar with the road, it was very fast drive back down. There was a problem on the river in between Kagbeni and Jomsom.",
          "Because of the continuous five days of rain, we were not able to cross the river with the bike. A local bus driver helped us. It was cloudy with patchy drizzle when we were about to reach Pokhara. Though long we enjoyed the day at our best. We went to the Busy Bee for the dinner. Busy Bee, one of the most recommended bars in Pokhara. We shared a large size pizza for the dinner.",
          "On the last day, we drive back to Kathmandu. It was a pretty easy ride. Nepal is safe after an earthquake. There is still a lot of places to go for the adventure! My friend is planning for Manaslu and Everest Trek, keep checking updates on the blog. You can start planning Upper Mustang Trip during the Tiji Festival 2016. I want to go there again during the Tiji, let me know if you are going! We could hike together."

Cultural diversity in different parts of Nepal except the mountains will keep you entertained. It usually rains during the night and there’s a clear sky in the morning. This makes trekking more exciting.",

But once you proceed towards the other side of the mountain you will feel the dry and windy summer weather. And no rain at all. During this time, few tourists go on treks due to the climatic situation. As a result, there will be less crowd. Peaceful trails and easier accommodations will add joy to you."

Literally, Shivaratri is composed of the two Nepali words ‘Shiva’ and ‘Ratri’; ‘Shiva’ is the name of the Hindu God, and ‘Ratri’ means night. According to legends, the day is supposed to be the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Pashupatinath (The Hindu Temple) is supposed to be visited by a couple of thousands of devotees on the festival’s single day.",
          "If you are in Nepal during the festival, I highly recommend visiting the Temple of Pashupatinath. Generally, Shivaratri falls in February. India and Mauritius are two other countries celebrating this festival locally. Thousands of devotees and sadhu flock come to Nepal almost a week before the festival and set the tents on the temple premises. This year it was on Feb 17th, and a couple of my friends made a plan to be in Pashupatinath for a celebration. This was my second time at Pashupatinath on the day of Maha Shivaratri.",
          "We had decided to be there at the main entrance, next to the bus station, not later than 11:00 a.m. But, because of the high flow of traffic, the regular entire for four-wheelers was diverted. , all of my friends walked for around thirty minutes to reach the preferred venue. There was a long queue to enter, and we were not ready for that cause’ it looked like we needed to spend a couple of hours waiting in a queue. We had an idea about a secondary entrance towards the temple, and we decided to give it a try for next to nothing. We had tried almost two or three entrances, but our attempts were unsuccessful. There was a broken fence, and people were jumping inside, but police had already taken the situation under control when we reached over the fence. We were walking around to find a loophole under high security. It was so hard to manage entry for the five of us. Luckily, there was no security and no queue, we ran there and entered, finally yes! We made an entry. It looked like the entire territory was sprayed with cannabis flavor. We could see people sitting in a group of four to five and smoking weed. You could see people stoned with marijuana. I felt like if Bob Marley were alive and attended this festival, he would have loved it. I spent the whole day next to the temple premises and observed the festival and serenity. Here are lists of five of the things you should do in Pashupatinath on Maha Shivaratri’s day."

You will definitely see a long queue there too. Continue downhill, and you will find a queue bend towards the right. Now you follow left and pass by the Bagmati River. Cross the first bridge you find and continue ahead. Soon you will find stone steps and an entry gate. Congratulation!! Now hike up and follow downhill stone stairs to reach the main temple premises. Although you can’t go inside the temple using this route, enjoy the temple and the crowd’s view. Choose a suitable place to sit either on the right or left of the staircase."

          "Are you trying to sing Nepali Song named Resham Firiri Resham Firiri?",
          "Well, this is a very famous song in Nepal with good lyrics. I will explain the entire song in English with proper meanings. Before that here is the lyric of this famous song.",
          "This is a JPEG file. Lyric is in the form of a picture instead of text. You can download it easily. I will not be talking about the history of this song. You can read it in WiKi, anytime you like. This is also a famous song in trekking. If you are going to Annapurna, small kids along the trail will entertain you with this song.",
          "If you are coming Nepal for Trekking, here is a useful link about Trekking in Nepal.",
          "Let’s begin with translation of the song title. Resham Firiri!",
          "Resham: Exact English translation of the word Resham is Silk.",
          "Firiri: I think there is no exact English translation of this word. Ok, I will try my best to describe this. Tie one end of a towel with a rope. Now, turn the blower on and move it towards the free end of towel. The flow of towel with the current of blower’s air is called Firiri in typical language. But the firiri in the song is supposed to be cause of natural air.",
          "Do you know the exact English word of Firiri now? If yes, let me know ?",
          "I will now translate line by line. Each line has unique meaning. The meaning of one line might not compliment with meaning of another line. They are just for rhythm. Basically it’s a love song. They are expressing their feelings and how their love started.",
          "Udera Jau Ki Dhada Ma Bhanjyang",
          "Udera – By flyingJau – GoKi – OrDhada – HillMa – InBhanjyang – Mountain Pass, Also refers to plain land on hilltop",
          "Excitement level so high! They are in love with each other. Basically, they don’t want to stay ideally in one place. They are wondering of fly over to the hilltop. They are simply talking to themselves, like shall I go to the top of the hill by flying. As if they can! Everything is possible in love and war, isn’t it?",
          "Kukur Lai Kuti Ma Kuti Biralo Lai SuriTimro Hamro Maya Priti Dobato Ma Kuri",
          "Kukur – DogLai – ForKuti Ma Kuti – Literally, when people saw a playful dog they used to say Kuti Kuti. (Kuti as a single word, doesn’t have an exact english translation)Biralo – CatSuri – Similar to Kuti Ma Kuti for dog, in Nepal we used to call Suri for cat. If you want to attract random cat in Nepal, just say Suri La, La.Timro – YourHamro – OurMaya Priti – LoveDobato – Junction of two roadsKuri – Wait",
          "Now it’s very simple to interpret the lines. Kukur lai kuti ma kuti, biralo lai suri. This means of calling a dog to love, it’s Kuti Kuti and for cat it’s Suri. Timro hamro maya priti dobato ma kuri; our love took place by waiting at the junctions of two roads. Maybe, boy or girl who ever is first will wait on the junctions for their lovers to arrive.",
          "Eak nale banduk dui nale banduk, mirga lai takaekoMirga lai maile takaeko hoina, maya lai dakaeko",
          "Eak – OneNale – BarrelDui – TwoBanduk – GunMirga – DeerTakaeko – PointedMaile – MeHoina – NotMaya – LoveDakaeko – Call",
          "Here, also, this stanza doesn’t make a sense when we read collectively. They are just for perfect rhythm. Look ‘Takaeko’ and ‘Dakaeko’, they are pretty similar. In the first line, single barrel and double barrel gun is being pointed towards the deer. And in the second line, they refuse that gun is being pointed toward the deer. Instead, they said they are calling their love. There is love everywhere, throughout the song. Hmm, maybe like they fire a gun and shout out – Honey, where are you? Come here!",
          "Aakash ma jhahaj shadak ma motor nabahye gada chaYo man jasto tyo man bhayae tagat ghada cha",
          "Aakash – SkyJhahaj – AirplaneShadak – RoadMotor – VehiclesNabhaye – Don’t haveGada – Pulling cartCha – HaveYo – ThisMan – HeartJasto – Be like (similar)Tyo – ThatTagat – StrengthGhada – Strong",
          "Here few words like Gada and Ghada, sounds similar. While writing in Nepali font, it is slightly different. Ok, here in the first line, they said if there is no plane in the sky and no motors on the road, then there exists a cart. In the second line it is said that, if both of their hearts are similar, then fantasy will stronger. Also, second line could be understood in different ways. We can relate it with love. If your heart is like mine in terms of feeling, then love is or will be deeper and sweet.",
          "Sano ma sano gai ko baccho, bhirai ma ram ramChodera jana sakina maile, baru maya sagai jau",
          "Sano – SmallGai – CowKo – ‘sBaccho – CalfBhirai – In slopeRam ram – when someone is about to dieChodera – By leavingJana – GoSakina – CannotMaile – MeBaru – InsteadMaya – LoveSagai – TogetherJau – Go",
          "In the first line, they are feeling pity for the small calf. The calf is on a dangerous slope. Ram is a name of Hindu god. It’s natural when someone is in trouble, he or she will yell god. Like Christian say sweet Jesus or lord Jesus.",
          "We Hindu have millions of gods, sometimes we are confused about whose name to yell. Ram is quite frequently used. In the second line, it’s about not leaving each other. I can’t go alone leaving you, so let’s go together. Here we can also correlate the meaning of two lines with each other. It is totally a personal perspective. Here, they are talking about a calf that is about to die in the first line. In the second line, they say one can’t leave the other, instead, they can go together. So I relate it, here is a different way. They love each other so much that they prefer to die together instead of leaving the other half alone. Or you can also interpret it in a different way. Like, one is promising not to leave the other in all the situations. Whatever situation they face, they wish to face together, even death.",
          "This is totally a love song. This is not a controversial theme of the song. It is all about love. Now you can memorize a lyric. If you read this post before you come to Nepal, memorize these nine lines. You can sing like a local. Also, I hope my interpretation of the song was somehow ok to understand the meanings. If you perceive this song in a different way, please share with others. This is not the exact translation of Resham Firiri song and its meaning in English.",
          "Are you ready to sing this song now?",
          "If yes then click play button on video below. Then scroll up and sing along with lyrics. This is probably the original version of this song.",
          "Also, when something is famous, people talk about it more. This song is very famous and some have changed the lyrics slightly, Kind of remix. Especially, your trekking crew might teach you some funny version of this song .",
          "Remix trekking version of Resham Firiri Song",
          "No doubt, Resham Firiri is the song that you need to learn before coming in Nepal."
