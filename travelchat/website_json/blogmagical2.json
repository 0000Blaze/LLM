          "Spring and Autumn offer the ideal combination of pleasant weather, stunning scenery, comfortable trekking conditions, and adequate resources, making them the best times to experience the Manaslu Circuit Trek. Here are several reasons why you want to choose Spring(March to May) and Autumn(September to November) to trek the Manaslu Circuit.",
          "Favorable weather conditions: Both seasons offer clear skies, stable weather patterns, and comfortable temperatures. This makes for pleasant trekking conditions with minimal risk of bad weather interfering with your journey.",
          "Clear mountain views: The lack of precipitation and mist during these seasons allows for stunning panoramic views of the Himalayas, including Mount Manaslu itself. This is a major draw for trekkers who want to experience the full beauty of the region.",
          "Lush landscapes: Spring boasts vibrant wildflowers and rhododendrons in bloom, while autumn showcases the colorful foliage of the lower valleys. This adds a unique and picturesque element to the trek.",
          "Pleasant temperatures: Both spring and autumn offer moderate temperatures that are neither too hot nor too cold. This makes the trek more enjoyable and less physically demanding.",
          "Open teahouses: All teahouses along the route are open and well-stocked during these peak seasons, ensuring comfortable lodging and readily available food and supplies.",
          "Longer days: Spring and autumn offer longer daylight hours, giving you more time to trek each day and explore the surrounding areas.",
          "Reduced risk of landslides: While the monsoon season brings lush greenery, it also increases the risk of landslides. Spring and autumn offer a safer trekking experience with less chance of encountering these hazards.",
          "While each season offers its unique charm, winter trekking on the Manaslu Circuit presents a special challenge. The snow-covered landscape becomes a wonderland, but crossing Larke Pass under heavy snowfall demands skill and experience. While most teahouses in Dharmasala close, Magical Nepal’s expert guides, equipped with knowledge of winter conditions and trusted local connections, are prepared to navigate these challenges, including opening teahouses and preparing food. This ensures a thrilling and unforgettable winter adventure for the intrepid trekker. Foods are limited in the winter season.",
          "The lush green beauty of the rainy season comes with its own set of challenges. Landslides can block trails, forcing detours or even turning back. Rain can make trekking unpleasant and limit visibility, obscuring the majestic Himalayas for most of the day. While views may be scarce, the vibrant green landscape offers its unique charm for the adventurous trekker who embraces the unpredictable nature of this season.",
          "Let’s delve into the unique offerings and challenges of spring, summer, autumn, and even winter. You will discover the landscapes, weather, and experiences that each season holds, helping you choose the perfect time for your Manaslu adventure."

The lower section of the trail basks in warmth, making daytime trekking comfortable even in winter. The initial trail winds through charming villages, subtropical forests, and cascading rivers. Winter paints the landscape in vibrant hues. The warmth of the sun during the day makes for comfortable trekking, while the crisp mountain air invigorates your senses.",
          "The cold you encounter is offset by the breathtaking sight of frozen waterfalls and rivers adding a touch of magic to the landscape. However, above Namrung, the path transforms into snow-covered terrain, and venturing further to Manaslu Base Camp is deemed too risky during the winter season.",
          "As you ascend above Namrung, the landscape undergoes a dramatic transformation. Towering waterfalls stand frozen in time, their icy sculptures shimmering in the sunlight. Rivers become glistening pathways of ice, adding a touch of magic to the environment. While the beauty is undeniable, these frozen landscapes require caution and careful navigation.",
          "With the Dharmasala lodge closed, crossing Larke Pass becomes a one-day challenge, requiring a minimum of 12-13 hours of endurance. While teahouses remain closed, our experienced guides prepare, carry keys, and cook delicious meals for our clients to ensure a comfortable and fulfilling trek. This high-altitude pass, standing at 5,160 meters (16,930 feet), demands physical endurance and mental fortitude.

But avoidance is better than cure, so keep well hydrated and alert the guide to any changes in your body.",
          "To avoid problems, we have an acclimatization day at Namche Bazaar and another at Dingboche.",
          "Acclimatization days don’t mean you are doing nothing.  It means walking around at a higher altitude and sleeping at a lower altitude to accustom your body to the height.  On our EBC trek, we have built-in interesting things to do and see on these two days."

          "Therefore, there are two acclimatization days to minimize the chances of altitude-related problems.  The first is at Namche Bazaar at 3,700m/ 12,139ft, and the second is at Dingboche at 3,956m/ 12,979ft. This way, your body gets used to the high altitude and the stress it is under.",

They will keep their eyes open for any symptoms you may have, but if you feel unwell, regardless of how slight it feels, you should report this to your guide immediately.  They aim to make this the best experience you have had – which includes keeping you well and safe."

The best way to acclimatize is to keep moving, be active, and remember why you are doing this trek – for the beauty of the countryside.

But above all, go slowly, listen to your body, be aware of any changes, and listen to your guide if he feels you are showing symptoms (which you might not notice)."

The high mountains on this trek include Dorje Lakpa (6,990m / 22,933 ft), Langtang Ri (6,370m / 20,898 ft), and Langtang Lirung (7,245m / 23,769 ft).

Sharing a room is perfectly normal. There is no heating in the sleeping rooms.",

Breakfast and dinner are taken in the teahouses at communal tables where you can discuss the day’s journey with others.  Some menus offer a variety of food.  Boiled water is usually available, rather than in plastic bottles, which hurts the environment.

Tigers do live here but are quite difficult to spot.",

We recommend staying at least 3 nights to enjoy the ambiance here fully.  It is less busy with tourists and more rustic in terms of accommodation and local villages.  Wildlife here consists of tigers, elephants, leopards, monkeys, and deer.  Like Chitwan, there is a huge range of bird life for those interested in bird watching. Jeep and walking safaris are offered, and rafting on the river with perhaps fishing.   Nightlife here is more confined to your lodge.",

It is easy to spend 2 nights in Chitwan with little difficulty because of the distance to Kathmandu.  As a result, there is a wide range of accommodations, some quite luxurious.  There is also a range of restaurants and bars in the tourist town of Sauraha for those who would rather party the night away.  The wildlife guides provide walking safaris, jeep safaris, and short canoe rides.  The main animals of interest are rhinos, deer, leopards, monkeys, and smaller mammals. Tigers do live here but are quite difficult to spot.   Chitwan is also on the road we will take at the end of the Manaslu Trek to reach Kathmandu; please ask us about this.",

We recommend staying at least 3 nights to enjoy the ambiance here fully.  It is less busy with tourists and more rustic in terms of accommodation and local villages.  Wildlife here consists of tigers, elephants, leopards, monkeys, and deer.  Like Chitwan, there is a huge range of bird life for those interested in bird watching. Jeep and walking safaris are offered, and rafting on the river with perhaps fishing.   Nightlife here is more confined to your lodge.",

Currently, it does not see a lot of visitors but offers the same safari options of the jeep and walking safaris.  It is more difficult to get to than Chitwan and requires either a private vehicle or to be collected from the nearest big town by the lodge vehicle."

          "Having only opened in the early 1990’s (and the Tsum Valley section much later) this has the feel of an exploratory trek, far off the beaten trail and far from crowds of trekkers.",
          "With average day lengths of 7 hours, it is a demanding trek and a high level of fitness is required to fully enjoy the adventure.",
          "On the Tsum Valley section of the trek, altitudes are over 3,000m and trekkers do have to cross the Larkya La at 5,160m, often through snow and ice, and sometimes fixed ropes may be necessary.",
          "The trek itself takes in thundering waterfalls and rivers; challenging rocky trails clinging to cliff faces; Gurung villages with rice and millet terraces; long and mentally challenging suspension bridges; mani walls, chortens, and other Buddhist shrines, particularly on the Tsum Valley section.",
          "Known as a hidden valley, the people, culture and landscape of the Tsum Valley is closely related to that of Tibet.",
          "In fact the trek goes very close to the Tibetan border. On this part of the trek, there is an opportunity to meet Buddhist monks and nuns and visit Milarepa’s Cave.",
          "And do look out for the beautiful mountain birds such as the Lophophorus, which is the national bird of Nepal.",
          "As far as mountain views go, there are stunning views of Mount Manaslu, and the Himalayan ranges of Simrang, Hiunchuli, Ngadi, Ganesh Himal, and Larkye Peak.",
          "From Larkya La there are spectacular views of icefalls and frozen lakes, Himlung Himal, Cheo Himal, Kangguru, and the massive Annapurna II.",
          "This is a trek for those who would love to experience changing landscapes and different cultures over the course of one trip. Stamina is required, but this is rewarded by stunning views of snow-capped mountains and a unique experience."

          "Although situated in a district badly hit by the April 2015 earthquake, this heritage trail was hardly affected at all and reopened to visitors three months after the quake and remains an area of outstanding beauty and culture.",
          "However, the trek takes in Tatopani (literally ‘hot water in Nepali) where there used to be warming hot springs. The hot springs have sadly disappeared after the earthquake.",
          "The Tamang Heritage Trail lies in what was previously a restricted area near the Tibet border and was opened up to visitors lately.",
          "The people in this area have a culture, tradition, and religion that goes back hundreds of years, and the craftsmanship, dress, and stone-mud houses are testimony of this ancient background.",

Flying a helicopter at such a high altitude has several challenges, including thin air, frigid temperatures, and the risk of high-altitude sickness.",
          "Due to these challenges, helicopter tours to Mount Everest Base Camp require a specialized team and highly trained pilots. Therefore, the cost of operating these tours is higher than it would be for other helicopter tours in Nepal. In addition, the logistics of organizing a tour to Mount Everest are more complete than landing a helicopter at Kalapathar.",

It’s also important to note that the weather can be different at different altitudes, with the higher altitudes generally experiencing colder temperatures. It’s always a good idea to check the weather forecast before embarking on a helicopter tour of Mount Everest and to dress appropriately for the weather conditions.",

Cutting out retracing your steps in the final days of the classic EBC trek and giving you a whole new viewpoint (literally) of Mount Everest.",
          "For this trek, you will need 8 days, which includes the arrival into the region and departure out of it.  Also included in this trek and helicopter tour is accommodation the night before your trip (Arrival Day) and the night at the end of your trip (Day 8) The accommodation in Kathmandu is in a three-star hotel in Thamel.",
          "Over these 8 days, you will witness the glories of the Himalayas, experience trekking through the land of  Sherpa communities (and the Yeti, if you believe the legends), through different types of landscapes, and encounter Tibetan Buddhism through the local people and the monks at Tengboche Monastery.",

          "Since this is the Himalayas, for every downward path there is an upward path!  In general, we are gaining elevation as we trek from Lukla to our final destination at Pheriche.  On that note, we take care not to travel too fast and stay well hydrated to minimize any risk of altitude-related problems.  Again, your guide will advise you.",
          "Lunch is taken on the trail.  This is a fun and interesting experience in itself.  Whether you feel ravenous or not hungry at all will depend on your body, but we suggest you try to eat something to give you more trekking power for the afternoon.",
          "Evenings follow a pattern of arriving at the lodge, perhaps enjoying a cold drink or cup of tea while ordering dinner and before washing off the day’s dust.  Then dinner is spent discussing the day and perhaps comparing notes with trekkers in other groups before heading to bed at an hour which would seem very early in your home daily life but is the norm on the trek."

          "Flights to the Everest Region now depart from Ramchhap airport due to congestion at the Kathmandu airport. Being that  Ramchhap is several hours’ drive from Kathmandu we leave Kathmandu at 1 am.  It is about a four-hour drive through amazing landscapes of foothills and lowlands, but hard to see until the sun comes up.  All flights in and out of mountainous areas are in the mornings, as there are often high winds in the afternoons.",
          "Planes can be delayed or cancelled due to bad weather in the Himalayas but in general, helicopters are able to fly so there are fewer delays for those taking helicopter flights.   But in case of delays, going either way, we suggest you ensure there is one or two days between landing in Kathmandu and your international flight home. Just to be on the safe side.",
          "Please give us a copy of your passport when you book. This is so we can arrange the domestic flight ticket – a copy of the passenger’s passport is required for booking.",
          "Porters are included in our package price.  Usually, one porter carries the luggage of two clients and can safely carry 20kg.   We request you pack a maximum of 10kg for the porter to carry – we will give you a suitable bag for your luggage.  Your day pack should contain only what you need on a daily basis and again we suggest you keep it light as you will be carrying it! .",
          "Airlines have a weight limit of 15kg per person, so again please ensure you pack light.",
          "Included in the price of your trek are the meals on the trail.  But this does not include hot or cold drinks, snacks, or alcohol.",
          "The lodges charge for hot showers ($3 to $5) and charging your phone or camera battery ($1 to $3). Please bring enough rupees to cover these costs and the costs of any drinks and extra food.  As it is pretty cold in the mornings and evenings, you might want to re-think your usual daily shower!",
          "Please exchange your foreign currency in Kathmandu before leaving for Everest.  We suggest you change around $20 to $30 for one day, depending on how much you drink/ charge/ shower! Beer is around Nrs700 to Nrs 1,000 and cold drinks around Nrs 400 per bottle. Mostly you will drink water but do bring some money for those luxury drinks like cola.",
          "We recommend that our clients, and other trekkers, do not drink alcohol on the trek.  Dehydration is a real worry at altitude.  And lack of judgment can be fatal. Be sensible and kind to your body.",

          "Different people have different appetites and tastes. Some are happy with a single meal, while others prefer to start with a drink and appetizers and then finish with a delicious dessert.",
          "On average, USD 30 per person per day is good for basic meals i.e. breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The menu below will give you an idea of how much you need for the trek for the foodies.",
          "In October 2022, I did a thirteen-day trek around the Manaslu Circuit. I took a photo of the food menus in different places, which you can find below",
          "The places I covered were Soti Khola, Jagat, Namrung, Sama Gaun, Samdo, Bimthang, Surki Khola, and Dharapani. Soti Khola is the starting point, and Dharapani is the ending point of the Manaslu Circuit Trek. Prices are in Nepali rupees. By the next few years, prices will hike by a certain percentage, somewhere between ten and fifteen percent. I believe this will help you to plan your budget."

          "Your guide will have explained the night before the route you are taking and what to expect on the trail.  The porters will set off ahead of you (yes, these amazing people walk fast) and you and your guide can set off at a pace right for your body.  Don’t forget to stop to take in the beauty of your surroundings.",

          "You may have heard that flights to Lukla in the Everest Region now leave from the far east of Nepal.  This means a four-hour road journey from Kathmandu in the early morning hours in order to board your plane at 6 a.m.",
          "We realize this is not ideal, but again we are unable to change this.  In the near future, we anticipate hotels will be built in this area, making life easier.  Meantime, please take the road trip as part of the overall adventure of the Himalayas!",
          "We need a copy of each passenger’s passport, when you book your trip, so we can purchase the domestic flight tickets.",
          "Porters are included in the price of your trip and it is normal for one porter to carry the bags of two trekkers.  These guys are amazing but are not superhuman so please keep your bag under 10kg in weight.  We will provide you with a bag best suited for being carried by the porter.",
          "In your day pack you should carry only what you need for that day: medications, water, snacks, sun cream, camera, and/or phone.",
          "Airlines have a weight limit of 15kg per person so please keep the weight down.",
          "Although meals on the trek are included in the cost, the price does not cover cold drinks, extra hot drinks, extra food or snacks, or alcohol.  It also doesn’t cover hot showers, charging your phone, etc., for which the lodge will charge extra.",
          "Hot showers are around $3 to $5 and battery charging is $1 to $3. You will need to pay for these services, and extra food/drink, in rupees.",
          "Please exchange your foreign currency in Kathmandu.  We suggest you bring around $20 to $30 worth of rupees per day.  Beer costs Nrs 700 to Nrs 1,000, cold drinks around Nrs 400 per bottle, and in the lower settlements, you may find a café latte at around Rs400.  Calculate and change money before setting off.",
          "Alcohol affects your hydration level which can heighten the risk of altitude sickness.  Stick to cold drinks, tea or coffee, and plenty of water.",
          "If you need more sugar there is a bakery in Dingboche and Namche.",
          "You can buy a Wi-Fi card in Lukla or Namche Bazaar http://everestlink.com.np/  for $25.  10 or 20 GB of data for 30 days in the Everest Region only. The strength of the signal is not guaranteed!",

          "Our seven-day trek to Everest Base Camp, including a helicopter tour and helicopter ride back to Kathmandu, is not dissimilar to our 6-day trek except there is more time in the mountains and the opportunity to visit Nangkar Tshang Peak with its sacred sites and views of Mt Makalu.",

          "Flying into the Hillary Tenzing Airport at Lukla has to be a thrill in itself.  That airport is high and challenging even for the well-experienced flight crew.  You may get the opportunity to watch other planes land and take off as you wait for your luggage to be processed by your porters.",
          "The Sherpa people are another huge highlight.  While many are engaged in the trekking and mountaineering business, others are still carrying out their daily lives as their ancestors, working their small farms or herding yaks.",
          "If you have an interest in Buddhism then Tengboche Monastery will be a highlight for you. If you have less interest in the spiritual side, the fabulous panorama from its courtyard will definitely add a renewed spirit to your journey.",
          "The Khumbu Ice Falls, glaciers, and glacier lakes and rivers will leave you spellbound.",

          "Then its time to head out.  That first gasp of air will be cold!  But you will warm up as you walk, and the weak sun will also bring some warmth.  Following the path set by your guide, feel free to ask him questions about the location and the route ahead.",

          "Before embarking on the trek, please consider the following notes.",
          "Flights to the Everest Region now depart from Ramchhap airport due to congestion at the Kathmandu airport.  Ramchhap is several hours’ drive from Kathmandu, so we are obliged to leave at 1 am. Please note there are no day or evening flights due to the high winds in the mountains in the afternoons.",
          "Whereas fixed-wing plane flights can be delayed or canceled due to bad weather, it is highly unlikely that the weather has an adverse effect on helicopter flights.  But in case of delays, going either way, please ensure there are one or two days between landing back in Kathmandu and your international flight out.",
          "Please provide us with a copy of your passport when you book so we can arrange the domestic flight ticket where they will request a copy of each passenger’s passport.",
          "Porters are included in this package.  Usually, one porter carries the luggage of two clients.  Please remember that one porter can only carry up to 20kg so pack accordingly – that is, around 10kg for the porter and whatever you are carrying in your day bag.  We will provide you with a bag/duffle bag that is easy for porters to carry.",
          "In your day pack you should carry whatever medications you may need during the day, water, snacks, camera, and/or phone.  And don’t forget sunscreen, regardless of the season.",
          "Airlines have a weight limit of 15kg per person. Please stick to that limit.",
          "Meals on the trek are included in the price.  This does not include hot or cold drinks, alcohol, or extra snacks, so bring Nepali rupees with you.",
          "The lodges charge extra for hot showers ($3 to $5) and charging your battery ($1 to $3) as it costs them to provide this service.  Again, please bring rupees with you to pay for this. We don’t think you will shower often – thus, limit the amount of shower gel you bring We can pretty much guarantee between Namche Bazaar and returning to Kathmandu you will not be so keen to shower due to the cold.",
          "Please exchange your foreign currency in Kathmandu before leaving for Everest.  You can budget around $20 to $30 worth of rupees per day, depending on how much you drink/ charge/ shower! Beer runs from around Nrs700 to Nrs 1,000 per can, cold drinks around Nrs 400 per bottle, and cappuccino, americano, and cafe latte will set you back around Nrs 400 (only available in the lower parts of the route).  So, calculate your anticipated spending. You can always use excess rupees back in Kathmandu..  Importantly, keep up your water intake.",
          "On the subject of alcohol, we do not recommend you drink when trekking.  It badly affects your hydration level which can heighten the risk of altitude sickness.  However, one cold beer on occasion may be too much of a temptation to resist.  And although you may not usually drink coke and the likes, somehow trekking makes us crave that sugary taste!",
          "It is handy to bring water-purifying tablets or similar on a trek.  Boiled water is available in the lodges, but again there is a charge for this.  Do not be tempted to drink from any spring or river – you never know what is happening upstream!  The same goes for snow unless you can guarantee it is newly fallen.",
          "If you need more sugar, aside from shops and bakeries in Namche, there is a bakery in Dingboche.",
          "You can buy a Wi-Fi card in Lukla or Namche Bazaar http://everestlink.com.np/  for $25.  10 or 20 GB of data are provided for use over 30 days in the Everest Region.  Wi-Fi quality is not guaranteed.  This depends on the weather and location you are in.",
          "Weather can change dramatically and quickly in the mountains, so please bear with us if there are delays.  Please follow the advice of your guide if he needs to change the itinerary in any way due to the weather.",
          "Drones are not permitted unless you have a special permit to fly them in the Everest Region because of the number of helicopters, often unscheduled, in the sky. It is tricky to obtain permission, so leave it at home unless you really need a drone and can deal with the bureaucracy yourself before the trip.",

          "The Sherpa people are another huge highlight.  While many are engaged in the trekking and mountaineering business, others are still carrying out their daily lives as their ancestors, working their small farms or herding yaks.",

          "Flights to the Everest Region now depart from Ramchhap airport due to congestion at the Kathmandu airport.  Ramchhap is several hours’ drive from Kathmandu, so we are obliged to leave at 1 am. Please note there are no day or evening flights due to the high winds in the mountains in the afternoons.",
          "Whereas fixed-wing plane flights can be delayed or canceled due to bad weather, it is highly unlikely that the weather has an adverse effect on helicopter flights.  But in case of delays, going either way, please ensure there are one or two days between landing back in Kathmandu and your international flight out.",
          "Please provide us with a copy of your passport when you book so we can arrange the domestic flight ticket where they will request a copy of each passenger’s passport.",
          "Porters are included in this package.  Usually, one porter carries the luggage of two clients.  Please remember that one porter can only carry up to 20kg so pack accordingly – that is, around 10kg for the porter and whatever you are carrying in your day bag.  We will provide you with a bag/duffle bag that is easy for porters to carry.",
          "In your day pack you should carry whatever medications you may need during the day, water, snacks, camera, and/or phone.  And don’t forget sunscreen, regardless of the season.",
          "Airlines have a weight limit of 15kg per person. Please stick to that limit.",
          "Meals on the trek are included in the price.  This does not include hot or cold drinks, alcohol, or extra snacks, so bring Nepali rupees with you.",
          "The lodges charge extra for hot showers ($3 to $5) and charging your battery ($1 to $3) as it costs them to provide this service.  Again, please bring rupees with you to pay for this. We don’t think you will shower often – thus, limit the amount of shower gel you bring We can pretty much guarantee between Namche Bazaar and returning to Kathmandu you will not be so keen to shower due to the cold.",
          "Please exchange your foreign currency in Kathmandu before leaving for Everest.  You can budget around $20 to $30 worth of rupees per day, depending on how much you drink/ charge/ shower! Beer runs from around Nrs700 to Nrs 1,000 per can, cold drinks around Nrs 400 per bottle, and cappuccino, americano, and cafe latte will set you back around Nrs 400 (only available in the lower parts of the route).  So, calculate your anticipated spending. You can always use excess rupees back in Kathmandu..  Importantly, keep up your water intake.",
          "On the subject of alcohol, we do not recommend you drink when trekking.  It badly affects your hydration level which can heighten the risk of altitude sickness.  However, one cold beer on occasion may be too much of a temptation to resist.  And although you may not usually drink coke and the likes, somehow trekking makes us crave that sugary taste!",
          "It is handy to bring water-purifying tablets or similar on a trek.  Boiled water is available in the lodges, but again there is a charge for this.  Do not be tempted to drink from any spring or river – you never know what is happening upstream!  The same goes for snow unless you can guarantee it is newly fallen.",
          "If you need more sugar, aside from shops and bakeries in Namche, there is a bakery in Dingboche.",
          "You can buy a Wi-Fi card in Lukla or Namche Bazaar http://everestlink.com.np/  for $25.  10 or 20 GB of data are provided for use over 30 days in the Everest Region.  Wi-Fi quality is not guaranteed.  This depends on the weather and location you are in.",
          "Weather can change dramatically and quickly in the mountains, so please bear with us if there are delays.  Please follow the advice of your guide if he needs to change the itinerary in any way due to the weather.",
          "Drones are not permitted unless you have a special permit to fly them in the Everest Region because of the number of helicopters, often unscheduled, in the sky. It is tricky to obtain permission, so leave it at home unless you really need a drone and can deal with the bureaucracy yourself before the trip.",

In the Everest Region the routes are more limited – there are not so many choices of places to go. As far as local culture is concerned, in the Everest Region you will only find Sherpa people and culture. An additional plus for Annapurna is that you can pick a shorter trail if you have limited time and you are not trekking at such a high altitude as in the Everest Region. And, if you do not like domestic flights, you do not have to fly to reach the Annapurnas. On the other hand, in the Everest Region there is the highest mountain in the world – which draws many trekkers and mountaineers annually."

Jeep and walking safaris are offered, and rafting on the river with perhaps fishing.   Nightlife here is more confined to your lodge.",

In the Everest Region the routes are more limited – there are not so many choices of places to go. As far as local culture is concerned, in the Everest Region you will only find Sherpa people and culture. An additional plus for Annapurna is that you can pick a shorter trail if you have limited time and you are not trekking at such a high altitude as in the Everest Region. And, if you do not like domestic flights, you do not have to fly to reach the Annapurnas. On the other hand, in the Everest Region there is the highest mountain in the world – which draws many trekkers and mountaineers annually."

Jeep and walking safaris are offered, and rafting on the river with perhaps fishing.   Nightlife here is more confined to your lodge.",

Just a 360-degree panorama of the wonderful mountains – who could ask for more?",
          "With the trek’s highest point being at Annapurna Base Camp, 4,130 m / 13,549 ft, there is only one night at high altitude, so there is relatively less chance of altitude-related illnesses on this all-seasons, eight-day trek.",

          "It is a difficult and strenuous trek not to be undertaken lightly.  But for those who do decide to make the effort, it is one of the most rewarding adventures you can have.",
          "The first part of the planning is to plan your own physical fitness.  The second is to learn as much as you can about the region before you go so nothing will surprise you. Well, many things will surprise you, but at least you will be prepared!  Getting the right gear and thinking about the altitude you will be hiking at is also something to plan in advance.",
          "And finally, be prepared to see the most stunning mountains on the planet with their rocky outcrops, and snowy and sometimes cloud-covered summits.  This is 12-14 days of tough walking, mingling with locals and other trekkers, being inspired and awed by the scenery and having a sense of achievement."

          "The only way to deal with high altitude-related illnesses is to go lower.  There is a phrase “Climb high, sleep low” which is exactly what the mountaineers on Everest are doing.  It is something trekkers should do also if they feel unwell.   Headache, dizziness, feeling sick, loss of appetite, unable to sleep…  take it seriously.  The ultimate price to pay for ignoring the signs is death.",

Surrounded by mountains such as Ama Dablam, Lhotse and Thamserku, and standing amidst glaciers, glacier lakes and rivers, this part of the country is truly unbeatable.",
          "It is a strenuous trek you need to prepare well in advance for. Regardless as to how fit you are in your everyday life, no matter how many marathons you have run or how many times a week you go to the gym, hiking at altitude is completely different.  The best way to prepare is to keep doing your usual exercise routines but step up walking or hiking, particularly up hills.",
          "Preparing your gear is also important.  Just like you need to be fit, your gear needs to be suitable for the Himalayas.  Good hiking boots, appropriate clothing and a good sleeping bag are the basics.",
          "Preparing your mind is also important.  A positive outlook will get you far in the mountains.  Particularly at the times when your legs hurt, your skin is burnt by the high altitude sun, you think you are developing a blister…  Being able to look past these things and concentrate on the beauty surrounding you and looking forward to a good dinner will make your trek so much more enjoyable."

          "Altitude sickness should not be taken lightly mainly because no one knows who will get sick and who will not.  Overall age and fitness have nothing to do with it.  Going too fast, not acclimatizing, and not staying hydrated, are major factors.",
          "If you develop a headache, monitor it.  Tell your companion, guide, porter, or lodge owner.  If you get overly tired yet are unable to sleep, lose your appetite, feel dizzy or feel sick you might be suffering from altitude sickness. Again, tell others.   For milder cases, the best thing to do is not go any higher or go down to the previous lodge if you are already quite high.",

Skies are clear, the snow is crisp – both on the mountains and underfoot and there are fewer flight delays as the weather is good for flying at this time. Flights may be less expensive at this time too.",
          "On the other side of the coin, it is cold!  You must be prepared for the cold and damp and some routes are not possible due to mountain passes being blocked by snow.  At the same time, some of the higher teahouses will be closed because of the snow conditions. Those which are open may offer you the best room at a cheaper price due to a low number of trekkers coming through at this time.  So do enquire, but do not haggle over a dollar or two with the lodge owner.  Winter is hard on them.",
          "We recommend you go with a guide in January because the trails will be different from those on your map or on signposts because of the closure due to snow.  And existing trails may be hard to read if there is fresh snowfall overnight.  A guide experienced in trekking in this region, and trekking in the winter months, is quite vital in January."

          "On the cons side – there are fewer trekkers around.  So for you who like to share stories at dinner time, you might find this a bit off-putting.  Some of the trekking lodges are closed during the winter as the owners head down the mountains to wait out the cold. There may also be fewer choices on the menu due to goods not coming in as frequently.  But food will always be delicious and hot.  You might have to extend your trek due to snowfall or amend your route.  Taking advice from the lodge owner is highly recommended as they know the problems associated with snow in the winter.  Travelling solo during the winter months is not recommended from a safety point of view.  And it’s cold!"

          "There is another acclimatization day at Dingboche.  It is for your own safety that these acclimatization days are fixed within the normal trekking schedule if you are travelling with a guide or agency.  If you are travelling alone we cannot stress enough how important it is to take these days, even if you feel you are doing fine and are overall very fit and healthy.  It doesn’t matter how high your fitness level or stamina is, unless you are born and bred at high altitudes you must obey nature’s rules: the effects of altitude sickness can be lethal.",
          "We have detailed information about altitude sickness on another page, but let us remind you briefly.",
          "If you have a headache, take note of it.  It might be more serious than you think. Mild symptoms are headache, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, inability to sleep, and dizziness.  You can prevent or resolve these symptoms by acclimatizing (as EBC Trek itineraries suggest).  If they get worse even after staying two nights where you are, then you should descend immediately to a lower altitude. The worst-case scenario is that it develops into High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) when you have mental confusion, and find balance and coordination difficult.   The problem here is now with the mental confusion, you may not recognise you are very unwell.  Another reason to trek with a guide or porter.  HACE can very very quickly get worse and if untreated the result is death.",
          "Yes, this sounds frightening.  But it is a very real fact in high places such as the Everest Region.  Almost everyone coming in will have a headache of some sort until they become used to the less oxygen in the air.  A few will develop something more serious.  And it doesn’t matter your age, fitness or previous experience of hiking."

          "Aiming mainly for those actually on Everest (climbing expeditions), you might find more information relevant to your trek but again it is aimed at those on the mountain.  Putting the setting to 4,000m may give you an idea of what is happening at lower altitudes.",
          "Coping with Cold and Altitude",
          "Please follow the advice we gave above regarding altitude.  Namely, even if trekking alone, please ensure you take acclimatization days as per the ‘regular’ EBC Trek itinerary.  Take more breaks if you feel you need to.  It is never a race to reach base camp and back.   Be aware if you feel unwell, especially if you have a headache that worsens or feel nauseous, unsteady or have palpitations.  Altitude sickness is a very real threat.",
          "As far as coping with the cold is concerned, make sure you have the correct clothes.  Waterproof boots, several pairs of socks, waterproof over trousers for deep snow or snowfall, a thick down jacket and lots of layers.  Don’t forget good gloves and hat(s).  Be prepared with another set of similar clothing in case you get wet. If you find you are sweating with the exertion of the day’s hike, please ensure you change your undergarments (or anything else that might be damp) when you reach the lodge.  You don’t want to get a chill due to wearing damp clothing.",
          "Travel Insurance and Emergency Services",
          "Please make sure your travel insurance covers trekking. And covers trekking up to (or over) 5,000m.  Always read the small print!  Helicopter rescues are available in case of incidents but they will not come out unless you can prove you can pay them ie through your insurance company.",
          "There are some health posts at various points along the trail but bear in mind they may be closed in the winter season.  If in doubt, talk to your lodge owner.  Again, do not expect anything if you are uninsured.  The locals see thousands of people pass through their communities and cannot be expected to financially help anyone in trouble.  Having said that, they will, of course, do their best to assist you in an emergency situation with advice and making calls.",

          "It is still off-season for trekking in the Himalayan mountains so ‘off-season’ deals still apply.  With fewer trekkers around, you can get the best accommodation at a reasonable price, have your choice of date for flights, and enjoy a more peaceful time on the trails.  If you spend the whole month in the region, you will, however, definitely notice an uptake in numbers by the end of February.",
          "To get the best of the month, without being too cold, we recommend coming mid-month when it is quieter but the sun is beginning to break through.  Higher up teahouses will be reopening after their winter break so you should have to worry about whether lodges in a certain area are open or not.  But we always recommend you check, just in case it’s a particularly long winter.",
          "Some of the high passes, such as those on the Three Passes Trek will probably still be closed due to snowfall. And despite the rising temperatures, it will still be cold!

Some trails may close, others may become difficult to recognize.  Be willing and able to change your plans at the last minute.  Again, it is for this reason we recommend taking an experienced guide with you.",
          "In May 2023 a porter was lost, with fatal results, on the trail when heavy snow separated him from his group and he was unable to find the trail.  In May.

          "On the negative side, there are fewer people to converse with at dinner.  Less fun in the teahouses. But if that is not a problem for you, it might not be negative! Some of the trekking lodges are closed during the winter.  By February they will be opening up again, but things might not be fully open, or items on the menu are still not available yet.",
          "You might have to extend your trek due to snowfall or amend your route. So remember to build in contingency days before any international flight out of the country.  Overall, take the advice of the lodge owners as they know the location, the weather, and its outcome on the trails.  Do not travel alone during the winter.  It’s only common sense if you think about it.  If you really must travel alone, come in the spring."

Here on the Everest Base Camp Trek, we recommend acclimatization by spending two nights in Namche Bazaar.  You will see this also on any reputable agent’s website.  The best way to acclimatize is by being active – which means walking for 3 or 4 or more hours each day.  There is also another acclimatization day at Dingboche as you are again going higher.",
          "These acclimatization days are for your own safety.   If you are traveling alone, we can tell you without these acclimatization days, at best you will feel tired and drained of energy.  At worst, you will fall ill.  Unfortunately, it is usually the younger trekkers who believe their general youth and fitness will do the trick that travels too fast and get into trouble medically.",
          "We don’t want to scare anyone or put you off this fabulous trek, but we must repeat it doesn’t matter how high your fitness level or stamina is, unless you are born and bred at a high altitude you must obey nature’s rules: the effects of altitude sickness can be lethal.",
          "We have detailed out information about altitude sickness on another page, but let us remind you briefly.",
          "If you have a headache be aware might be more serious than you think. Mild symptoms of altitude problems are headache, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, inability to sleep, and dizziness.",
          "You can prevent or resolve these symptoms by acclimatizing and taking the trek slowly.  Should your symptoms get worse after staying two nights where you are, then you should descend immediately to a lower altitude. The worst-case scenario is that it develops into High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) when you have mental confusion, and find balance and coordination difficult.   The problem is that with mental confusion, you may not recognize you are very unwell.",
          "HACE can very very quickly get worse and if untreated the result is death.  Again, we stress the importance of traveling with a guide and porter who can help you recognize the symptoms and take steps to ensure you do not get really sick.  At least, alert the lodge owner if you feel unwell.",
          "This is a very real fact in high places such as the Everest Region – we are not trying to scare you.  Be aware everyone coming in will have a headache of some sort until they become used to the less oxygen in the air.  Only a few people will have this develop something more serious.  And it doesn’t matter your age, fitness, or previous experience of hiking."

          "Meditate in Ramtang and Oktang Monasteries after your tiring walks",
          "Have an amazing time on the lap of the giant peaks",
          "The Kanchenjunga Circuit trek visits both the north and south base camps of Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world at 8,586m.",
          "Due to the fact this is a remote area trek, a good level of fitness and some trekking experience is desirable. Yet despite of its remoteness, trekkers gain insight into peoples’ way of life and can visit Ramtang and Oktang Monasteries.",
          "On the way, the landscape is filled with rivers; waterfalls; green meadows; rhododendron, birch and pine forests; the Yalung Glacier, and of course, visitors are accompanied on the route by the majestic mountains.",
          "Kanchenjunga itself lies on the far eastern side of Nepal, near the border with Sikkim, a tiny Himalayan state in the north-eastern part of India. Until mid-1800, it was thought Kanchenjunga was the highest peak in the world.",
          "This area was closed to trekkers until the mid-1980. Today the region is protected by the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area and a special trekking permit is required. With these restrictions, the beautiful and unique flora and fauna of this area is still in pristine condition today.",
          "With regards to the mountains themselves, in addition to the main peak of Kanchenjunga, there are four subsidiary summits exceeding 8,000m, the most important being Kanchenjunga West, also known as Yalung Kang (8,505m). Also found in this area are approximately twenty peaks exceeding 7,000m, the highest being Kambachen (7,903m), Janu (7,710m), Jongsong (7,483m), Kabru (7,353m), Tent Peak (7,365m) and the Twins (7,350m).",
          "In addition, there are numerous peaks over 6,000m. Amongst this impressive cluster of peaks are five major glacial systems. Of these, Zumu, Talung and Rathong flow into Sikkim while to the west, the Kanchenjunga and Yalung glaciers flow into the mighty Tamor River of Nepal.",
          "This just adds to the fact trekking in Kanchenjunga is an unforgettable experience where trekkers get right into the heart of the remote, less trekked, Himalaya mountains and valleys.",
          "With the recent addition to the trekking map of the Great Himalayan Trail, tourism is being promoted in this, as well as other, remote areas so there is the opening up of more teahouses on the route. While this is positive for the local communities, now would be a good time to go to Kanchenjunga before more trekkers ‘discover’ the area!"

          "Due to the fact this is a remote area trek, a good level of fitness and some trekking experience is desirable. Yet despite of its remoteness, trekkers gain insight into peoples’ way of life and can visit Ramtang and Oktang Monasteries.",
          "On the way, the landscape is filled with rivers; waterfalls; green meadows; rhododendron, birch and pine forests; the Yalung Glacier, and of course, visitors are accompanied on the route by the majestic mountains.",
          "Kanchenjunga itself lies on the far eastern side of Nepal, near the border with Sikkim, a tiny Himalayan state in the north-eastern part of India. Until mid-1800, it was thought Kanchenjunga was the highest peak in the world.",
          "This area was closed to trekkers until the mid-1980. Today the region is protected by the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area and a special trekking permit is required. With these restrictions, the beautiful and unique flora and fauna of this area is still in pristine condition today.",
          "With regards to the mountains themselves, in addition to the main peak of Kanchenjunga, there are four subsidiary summits exceeding 8,000m, the most important being Kanchenjunga West, also known as Yalung Kang (8,505m). Also found in this area are approximately twenty peaks exceeding 7,000m, the highest being Kambachen (7,903m), Janu (7,710m), Jongsong (7,483m), Kabru (7,353m), Tent Peak (7,365m) and the Twins (7,350m).",
          "In addition, there are numerous peaks over 6,000m. Amongst this impressive cluster of peaks are five major glacial systems. Of these, Zumu, Talung and Rathong flow into Sikkim while to the west, the Kanchenjunga and Yalung glaciers flow into the mighty Tamor River of Nepal.",
          "This just adds to the fact trekking in Kanchenjunga is an unforgettable experience where trekkers get right into the heart of the remote, less trekked, Himalaya mountains and valleys.",
          "With the recent addition to the trekking map of the Great Himalayan Trail, tourism is being promoted in this, as well as other, remote areas so there is the opening up of more teahouses on the route. While this is positive for the local communities, now would be a good time to go to Kanchenjunga before more trekkers ‘discover’ the area!"

Since Sherpa people originate from Tibet, where they were nomadic and eventually moved to eastern Nepal around 600 years ago, they are Buddhist.  Today they still follow the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism founded by Guru Rimpoche.",

          "Day 2 is perhaps the most interesting as it is the Cham Dances. Otherwise known as masked dances, today the courtyard of the monastery is alive with demons and protectors.  In all, there are 15 dances with different stories of the main theme of how Guru Rinpoche spread Buddhism and overcame evil.  This is perhaps the most interesting for foreigners to see.  And like all Buddhist sites, while being respectful, it is possible to come and go during the day if you need a break from it all.",
          "Day 3 is the Jinsak Fire Puja. In the early morning, there will be offerings in the courtyard: ghee is set in the firewood, the ashes of which are said to be very auspicious.  Finally, the mandala that took days to make is destroyed, the sand being taken the next day to be offered to the serpent gods in the river nearby.",

          "The Gokyo Cho La Pass Everest Base Camp Trek is more technically advanced than some of the other treks in the area – and therefore more adventurous!",
          "It encompasses all the ‘usual’ sights in the area, such as Namche Bazaar, Tengboche Monastery, Gorak Shep, and Everest Base Camp, but also includes a visit to the Gokyo Lakes by crossing the high altitude Cho La Pass (5,330m).",
          "There are some long days of 8 to 9 hours but the majority are 5 to 6 hours in length. This is a stunning trek for those with stamina and a sense of adventure.",
          "Flying in and out of Lukla ensures the maximum amount of time is spent in the mountains. However, acclimatization is a must and this is done in the famous Namche Bazaar, from where it is possible to take a short, but steep walk to Syangboche for your first close-up of Mount Everest, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, and Thamserku.",

          "Coming close to the Ngozumpa Glacier trekkers are awarded for making the narrow and steep climb when they reach three of the Gokyo Lakes with their turquoise, clear water.",
          "A highlight of this trek is the steep climb up to Gokyo Ri (5,357m) to view Mount Everest, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, and Makalu. This climb provides you with both stunning mountain views and acts as acclimatization for the long day ahead to cross the Cho La Pass.",
          "In order to cross the pass before the winds set in, it is necessary to start the day very early, around 4 or 5 am. It’s a tough day with the top of the pass being at over 5,300 m. Part of the trail is over ice, making it a real once-in-a-lifetime achievement!",
          "This feeling of achievement continues as the trekking route goes on to Gorak Shep, Everest Base Camp, and Kalapatthar, also known as Everest View Point.",
          "This trek certainly has its challenges such as long and strenuous walking days but the rewards more than make up for it in terms of personal achievement and a unique album of glorious photographs! If you think trekking is not for you. but you still want to see gokyo chola pass and EBC, consider doing a Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour."

On the lower parts of the trek, there are some more comfortable guest houses, which you could perhaps explore at the end of your journey.",

          "But why do trekkers need to acclimatize, even those who are very fit and young?  There is less oxygen in the air the higher in altitude you go.  Bodies need time to adjust to that fact or be susceptible to altitude-related illness.",
          "Altitude problems are with a simple headache. This is something most people will get by the time they reach Namche, but the majority will also adapt, and the headache will go.  However, if you ignore the signs, do not acclimatize fully and push on at speed you are opening yourself up to altitude problems.  The worse outcome of this is death.  It is something easy to avoid, but something to be taken very seriously as we will explain below."

          "Although most of the park is flat, forest-covered land, it also takes in the Sivalik Hills and runs along the southern part of Nepal, bordering India to the south.  It is the traditional home to the Tharu people, most of whom were moved out when the park boundaries were set up.",
          "It has a sub-tropical climate, making it very hot in the dry and monsoon seasons.  Most of the forests are of sal trees and a large area of high grasses, traditionally cut and used as building materials for local houses.",
          "Because of its close location to Kathmandu, Chitwan National Park has grown as a popular tourist destination.  Originally it was more a place for wildlife enthusiasts, but as lodges and hotels became more comfortable, it became more attractive to all visitors."

          "The Gokyo Lakes are actually made up of six bodies of water, or lakes, located at an altitude of 4700 to 5000m in the Gokyo Valley. Gokyo Valley falls within the Sagarmatha National Park area.",

And if you need any more testaments to the beauty and importance of this area, Lonely Planet states, “for our money, the Gokyo Valley is the most spectacular in the Khumbu.”",

          "You should expect to walk around 5 hours a day, with one of the highlights being a steep climb up to Gokyo RI (5,357m) to view Mount Everest, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, and Makalu. Also on display is the largest glacier in Nepal, Ngozumpa, and ice ridges. If walking 5 hours a day is not an option for you and you still want to see the pristine beauty of Gokyo lake, consider a helicopter tour.",

          "The route to the Gokyo Lakes is less busy but still affords the trekker an insight into local village life, impressive views of icy rivers and stony, glacier debris, snow-capped mountains, and of course, the dazzling turquoise waters of Gokyo Lakes themselves.",
          "The Gokyo Lakes are actually made up of six bodies of water, or lakes, located at an altitude of 4700 to 5000m in the Gokyo Valley. Gokyo Valley falls within the Sagarmatha National Park area.",
          "The lakes are the world’s highest freshwater lake system and have been designated as a Ramsar site (wetlands of international importance) and sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists. And if you need any more testaments to the beauty and importance of this area, Lonely Planet states, “for our money, the Gokyo Valley is the most spectacular in the Khumbu.”",
          "By spending an extra day in the Gokyo Valley, you can visit the 5th and 6th lakes in a high alpine bowl at the foot of Cho Oyu, the world’s 6th highest mountain.",
          "You should expect to walk around 5 hours a day, with one of the highlights being a steep climb up to Gokyo RI (5,357m) to view Mount Everest, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, and Makalu. Also on display is the largest glacier in Nepal, Ngozumpa, and ice ridges. If walking 5 hours a day is not an option for you and you still want to see the pristine beauty of Gokyo lake, consider a helicopter tour.",
          "To acclimatize before setting off for the Gokyo Ri and Gokyo Valley, time spent in Namche Bazaar offers you the opportunity to trek to nearby Khumjung Village to visit the school set up by Sir Edmund Hillary, who, along with Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, was the first person to successfully summit Mount Everest.",

          "Kongma La Pass has been described as more of a ‘precarious struggle among skittering stones.’ The route takes you across a glacier, and glacier-fed river, and the climb up to the pass at 5,535m /18,159 ft is the highest on this trip.",

          "The names of which are very familiar to anyone who has an interest in the Everest region or knows something about the history of Mount Everest.",

          "Here are some long days (9 hours) and strenuous accents, so a high level of fitness is required. The trek combines crossing these passes with the other ‘must-do’ areas of the Khumbu: Everest Base Camp, Namche Bazaar, Tengboche Monastery, and the Gokyo Lakes.",

          "Kongma La Pass has been described as more of a ‘precarious struggle among skittering stones.’ The route takes you across a glacier, and glacier-fed river, and the climb up to the pass at 5,535m /18,159 ft is the highest on this trip.",
          "You can regain your breath as you take in the views from the top of the pass where Lhotse and Makula feel their presence and the view of the turquoise lakes below contrasts the majesty of the mountains.",

          "At three points, namely Phakding, Lukla and Namche Bazaar this means you will be staying in the Yeti Mountain Home luxury lodges. Designed for luxury and based on the traditional designs of the Khumbu (Everest) Region, these are the five-star hotels on the Everest trails!",
          "You will get your first glimpse of the beauty of this region from the short flight into Lukla. Flying directly to through the mountains, this airport sits at 2,860m.",
          "On arrival in the early morning trekkers set off to descend to the first stop. Phakding lies around 4 hours walk from Lukla. Set on the riverside, you can relax in the gardens of Phakding Yeti Mountain Home for the rest of the afternoon.",
          "From now on the days consist of around 5 hours of trekking. Some days are longer at 7 to 8 hours. But we build in acclimatization time and never force clients to go faster than their ability. The trails pass through forests of alpine trees and through picturesque Sherpa villages.",
          "Not to mention the raging rivers you will cross until you reach the well-known market town of Namche Bazaar. Here again we overnight in a Yeti Mountain Home. With a spa and wellness centre and well-stocked bar, we suggest you might want to enjoy these facilities fully on the return journey!",
          "While in Namche we take the opportunity to acclimatize to the altitude with a rest day. However, the best way to acclimatize is to remain active so you might want to hike to Khumjung Village to visit the school set up by Sir Edmund Hillary.",
          "As well as following in the footsteps of famous mountaineers, the highlights of this trek include the mountains. Of course! Our first great panoramic view comes at Tengboche Monastery where we can see breathtaking views of Mt Everest, Ama Dablam, Thamserku, Nuptse and Lhotse. For those who enjoy the spiritual, it is possible to meet some of the monks living here.",
          "Aside from the mountains, this area has an abundance of flora and fauna. It falls within the Sagarmatha National Park and the Sacred Himalayan Landscape initiative of the World Wildlife Fund.",
          "As you would expect, the trails passe the glaciers and icefalls and takes you up to Kalapatthar, otherwise known as the Everest Viewpoint. Here is the closest you will get to Everest without a climbing permit and expedition team! The views are beyond words, Everest, Mount Pumori and Amba Dablam seem to be within arm’s reach.",
          "During this part of the trek we use the best available lodges but once we return to Namche Bazaar we will again stay at the Yeti Mountain Home and perhaps have just one or two drinks at the bar. Or a lovely spa treatment. For our final night in the Khumbu Region, we stay at the Yeti Mountain Home at Lukla. And yes, go on and treat yourself to another spa. For when else are you going to have a massage high up in the Himalayas!"

          "You will get your first glimpse of the beauty of this region from the short flight into Lukla. Flying directly to through the mountains, this airport sits at 2,860m.",
          "On arrival in the early morning trekkers set off to descend to the first stop. Phakding lies around 4 hours walk from Lukla. Set on the riverside, you can relax in the gardens of Phakding Yeti Mountain Home for the rest of the afternoon.",
          "From now on the days consist of around 5 hours of trekking. Some days are longer at 7 to 8 hours. But we build in acclimatization time and never force clients to go faster than their ability. The trails pass through forests of alpine trees and through picturesque Sherpa villages.",
          "Not to mention the raging rivers you will cross until you reach the well-known market town of Namche Bazaar. Here again we overnight in a Yeti Mountain Home. With a spa and wellness centre and well-stocked bar, we suggest you might want to enjoy these facilities fully on the return journey!",
          "While in Namche we take the opportunity to acclimatize to the altitude with a rest day. However, the best way to acclimatize is to remain active so you might want to hike to Khumjung Village to visit the school set up by Sir Edmund Hillary.",
          "As well as following in the footsteps of famous mountaineers, the highlights of this trek include the mountains. Of course! Our first great panoramic view comes at Tengboche Monastery where we can see breathtaking views of Mt Everest, Ama Dablam, Thamserku, Nuptse and Lhotse. For those who enjoy the spiritual, it is possible to meet some of the monks living here.",
          "Aside from the mountains, this area has an abundance of flora and fauna. It falls within the Sagarmatha National Park and the Sacred Himalayan Landscape initiative of the World Wildlife Fund.",
          "As you would expect, the trails passe the glaciers and icefalls and takes you up to Kalapatthar, otherwise known as the Everest Viewpoint. Here is the closest you will get to Everest without a climbing permit and expedition team! The views are beyond words, Everest, Mount Pumori and Amba Dablam seem to be within arm’s reach.",
          "During this part of the trek we use the best available lodges but once we return to Namche Bazaar we will again stay at the Yeti Mountain Home and perhaps have just one or two drinks at the bar. Or a lovely spa treatment. For our final night in the Khumbu Region, we stay at the Yeti Mountain Home at Lukla. And yes, go on and treat yourself to another spa. For when else are you going to have a massage high up in the Himalayas!"

These days are particularly challenging, and trekkers should be prepared for a hard, long climb and, if the weather closes in, perhaps wait it out before crossing into the previous night’s lodge.",

          "The days on this trek vary in terms of time and scenery.  On the whole, expect to hike for around 6 hours a day, but there are two days where you spend 8-plus hours on the trail.  That is when you climb up and over the Ngawal Via Kang La Pass (3,600 m / 12,171 ft) and the Thorong La Pass at over 5,400m/ 17,700 ft. These days are particularly challenging, and trekkers should be prepared for a hard, long climb and, if the weather closes in, perhaps wait it out before crossing into the previous night’s lodge.",
          "Lodges on this trek, known as teahouses, are quite basic. We suggest you bring your own sleeping bag and consider a sleeping mat.   There may be some nights you are required to share a room with other trekkers.  And bathrooms are shared spaces also.",
          "After crossing the Thorong La, accommodation improves, and there are some rather nice lodges throughout Mustang.  Food can be quite basic on this trek, with little or no meat available (we do not recommend eating meat on remote or high treks anyway).  Vegetables will be freshly prepared, and the tea is always hot!",
          "Being a remote area, we suggest you bring your own supply of energy or chocolate bars, as there are very few shops until you cross over into Mustang.",
          "The days start early after breakfast, taken in the same lodge we sleep in.  Dinner is taken in the next overnight location.  Lunch is taken on the trail and will most likely be noodles, rice, and curry.",
          "On the long trekking days, we do not go faster than our bodies, and the altitude will allow",
          "Two acclimatization days are built into the itinerary to prepare trekkers for the higher altitude going over the passes.",
          "Despite being a challenging and often demanding trek, the rewards are stunning scenery, an insight into a different side of Nepal, both culturally and scenically, and a great sense of achievement.",
          "Important Notes for the Nar Phu Valley Trek",
          "This is a two-week trek with some very long days.  Therefore, it would be sensible to have a trekking experience before embarking on this.  (We have many other treks in this and other regions for those less experienced.)",
          "A good fitness level is required, again, because of the long days and sometimes rough terrain.",
          "Be prepared mentally and physically for the challenging Thorong La Pass crossing.",
          "If you would like to continue your trek after Jomson (rather than flying back to Pokhara), please ask us about this option.",
          "Accommodation at some of the locations is very basic. Please be prepared for shared toilets and sleeping rooms in some lodges.",
          "Bringing your sleeping bag is recommended.",
          "Porters are not included in the cost of this trek, but we can offer you the use of a porter at an additional charge.  Please talk to us about this.",
          "Meals are included on the trek, but extra charges are payable to the teahouse/ lodge for things like hot showers and charging your phone/ camera.",
          "In some locations, it might be hard to charge your phone, so carry a power bank with you.",
          "Water is essential on a trek!  We recommend 3 liters a day. It is a good idea to bring a sterilization straw or drops with you.  Most lodges will provide you with boiled drinking water at a cost.  Please do not drink the stream water.  It might look delicious and cold, but you don’t know what is lying (literary) upstream!",
          "Meals are not provided in Pokhara, but we can recommend some great restaurants.",
          "Please ensure your insurance covers trekking up to an altitude of 5,000m.",
          "Please do not haggle with the lodge owners over prices.  It is often a long and expensive process to bring goods into remote areas.",
          "One night’s accommodation in Pokhara is included in the cost of the trek.  If you wish to stay longer in this beautiful lakeside town, please talk with us."

It is possible to meet some of the monks living here and perhaps enjoy a cup of tea with them.",

It’s all about getting used to the altitude.",

Symptoms occur due to our body not adapting well to having less oxygen at high altitudes. At 18,000 ft. (5,500m), there is 1/2 the oxygen available at sea level, and it is 1/3rd on top of Mount Everest. The body tries to adapt to lower amounts of oxygen in the air mainly by increasing the rate and depth of breathing so you breathe faster and deeper. There is also an increase in heart rate. Both of these mechanisms try to bring more oxygen to the body. An increase in the number of red cells occurs after staying at a high altitude for 2 weeks or longer and is important for persons who live at high altitudes. There is wide individual susceptibility to altitude which is genetically determined."

Diamox thus enhances the physiological response to altitude and acts as a mild diuretic. Side effects of the drug are tingling of fingers and toes and tingling around the mouth. Persons with severe allergies to Sulfa drugs should not take this drug. The prophylactic dose of Diamox is ½ of a 250mg tablet (125 mg) twice a day. Diamox will not mask the symptoms of altitude illness if it is to occur. Start taking Diamox the same day or the day before the ascent to 10,000 ft. (3,000m), continue it through your ascent to higher altitudes, and stop when you start descending. For persons allergic to sulfa drugs, it is possible to use dexamethasone(prescribed by a physician), a very potent steroid drug prophylactically at 4mg twice daily for 2-3 days during abrupt unavoidable ascents.",

          "For severe symptoms with HACE or HAPE, descent must begin immediately whenever feasible. Helicopter evacuation may be essential for descent unless there is a rapid improvement with medical treatment and walking down is feasible. Physical exertion, even when it is for the descent, can be detrimental for patients with HAPE. Severe HAPE patients should be carried down if helicopter evacuation is not possible.",

It is not recommended to ascend while still taking this drug by a symptomatic person. Dosage: 8mg initially, then 4 mg every 6 hours.",

This is used to tie a person over an acute crisis before descent is possible or pending helicopter evacuation. This bag is found in the Manang and Pheriche Himalayan Rescue Association Aid Posts, at Khunde Hospital, and at several other locations in the Everest region.

          "When thinking about going to the Everest Base Camp – EBC for a short – Trek, there are several factors to consider.  Not least is the weather.",
          "Assuming you are not tied to a certain time with regard to your annual leave, you should pick the time of year that is right for you in terms of availability (sometimes it is extremely hard to get a domestic flight or accommodation on the trail), your ability (harder to hike in snow or rain), and what you plan to do (photography, meet other trekkers, sample local life, or simply embrace the great outdoors).",
          "Most of the information you will read says ‘spring’ and ‘autumn’ are the best times to visit EBC. While this is true, this shouldn’t deter you from considering other times of the year.  And if you do go during spring and autumn, no one can guarantee that during your particular 14-day visit, the weather will behave itself!",

        "section_header": "Spring: March to May",
        "section_content": [
          "March to May is the busiest time in the Everest region for trekking and climbing.  With clear skies and glorious weather, it attracts visitors from all over the world.",
          "Since this was the best time to attempt to summit the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, it is no surprise that the first successful summit took place on 29 May 1953.  Every year we see a number of different expeditions on the mountain around this time – just waiting for what is commonly known as the good ‘weather window’ to push on for the final ascent.",
          "While climbing expeditions will be extremely well prepared for the cold weather – and it is extremely cold on the mountain – potential trekkers may be more interested to know how cold it will be for them on the route to Everest Base Camp and what they should carry in the way of clothing.",
          "Temperature: you might be surprised to know you may get a maximum of 20 degrees centigrade during the daytime and around 5 degrees at night.  Early mornings when you start your trek for the day and evenings will be cold, but during the day, you may want to ditch the heavier jacket and bask in the high-altitude sun!",
          "In regards to what to bring to wear, there are one-word ‘layers.’  You want to be able to wrap up warmly when it is chilly yet keep cool when the weather is warmer, and the hiking is heating you anyway.  So plenty of layers that are easy to take off (and then carry) on the trail.  Material that absorbs sweat is best for that first layer next to your skin, and a good fleece or down jacket is the final protection against the cold.  And, like we already said, the weather is not guaranteed, so don’t prepare only for those 20-day time degrees – it may be much cooler!",
          "Benefits of spring: Like spring in many locations, at the lower altitudes, this is the time to appreciate the lovely flowers and perhaps spot some wildlife – you are travelling in the Sagarmatha National Park, after all.  The sky will be blue, and the snowy mountains will glow against this clear backdrop.  There will be less likelihood of flight cancellations or delays due to bad weather.",
          "Disadvantages of Spring: The main disadvantage is the number of people on the trails.  Sometimes it may be difficult to get accommodation for the night unless you are traveling with a guide who has pre-booked for you. On the other hand, there will be plenty of company to share your stories in the evenings."

          "In the Everest Region, you should expect rain at the lower altitudes (below 3,500m) and some at higher altitudes. Again we cannot be sure of the exact weather.",
          "Temperature: it is also quite warm (18 degrees centigrade) in the daytime.  But if it rains, the temperature will, of course, drop considerably.  Early mornings and nights will be very cold, and you should be prepared for it to drop well below freezing.",
          "You should carry waterproof trousers (that slip over your normal trekking ones) and a waterproof jacket.  Remember to bring a waterproof cover for your backpack and your day pack.  Footwear should also be waterproof.",
          "Benefits of monsoon: the only advantage is that the trails will be very quiet.  Not many people chose to trek this season, so there should be plenty of choice regarding accommodation.  At lower altitudes, the forests will be washed clean, and the rivers running fast, forming waterfalls in various places.  The skies will be very atmospheric – white fluffy clouds, then dark, threatening rain clouds.",
          "The disadvantage of monsoon: the weather!  Not many people enjoy walking in the rain or climbing over slippery trails.  Although if the rain doesn’t bother you, when you get to higher altitudes, with less likelihood of rain, it will be glorious to have the trails to yourself. Another disadvantage is that flights are often delayed due to the weather.  But if you are not tied to an exacting timetable (never book your international flight the next day to a domestic flight), this can be turned into an advantage of another couple of days in the mountains!"

At the beginning of the season, rain in the lower altitudes is still possible.  Rain in the lowland areas of the country can also cause flight delays.  At the end of the season, there is the possibility of snowfall.  Both rain and snow will make the trails more slippery.

Known as the ‘Classic Everest Trek’ this trek is great for people with plenty time and also enables trekkers to acclimatize well to the altitude before climbing to the beautiful Everest viewpoint at Kalapatthar, which, at around 5,500m is the highest point of the trek.",

          "But such is the power of this region that even this deadly natural disaster has a twist: just a few hours after the earthquake, the sons of both Sir Edmund and Tenzing Norgay literally came face to face with each other while seeking shelter. Both of them were, unknown to each other, guiding trekking groups near EBC when the earthquake hit.",
          "This unique, spiritual power that Everest seems to have is something that also draws people from all walks of life to this area, along with the stunning mountain views, spectacular and sometimes challenging terrain, and the beauty of the Sagarmatha National Park, home of the allusive snow leopard and red panda. Not for nothing has this area been included in the Sacred Himalayan Landscape initiative by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).",
          "And let’s not forget the magnificent mountain itself. In order to reach Everest Base Camp, the trail runs alongside the Khumbu Glacier, offering spectacular views of the Khumbu icefall and the route to the South Col. The aptly named Everest View Point at Kalapatthar offers you the best views of Mount Everest, as well as Mount Pumori and Ama Dablam."

          "Enjoying longer days in the trekking trail.",
          "Enough time to spend on the extended pastures, yak farms, and glaciers",
          "Stunned by the chilling beauty of the Khumbu Glacier and Khumbu Icefalls",
          "The trek from Jiri to Everest Base Camp begins by taking road transport from Kathmandu to Jiri (approximately 8 hours) from where the trail begins. Known as the ‘Classic Everest Trek’ this trek is great for people with plenty time and also enables trekkers to acclimatize well to the altitude before climbing to the beautiful Everest viewpoint at Kalapatthar, which, at around 5,500m is the highest point of the trek.",
          "You need to be prepared to walk between 5 to 7 hours each day but there is plenty of time given to enjoy the views and take photographs. At the end of the trek, it is a short flight from Lukla Airport back to Kathmandu.",
          "While trekking through breathtaking scenery it’s impossible not to think about the mountaineers of old who forged not only the way up Everest but the trekking trails which are now world-famous.",
          "As a further reminder, prayer flags and mani stones are scattered along the trails, placed by the local peoples, trekkers, and mountaineers alike as an offering to the mountain, which is locally known as Sagarmatha (Goddess of the Sky) in Nepali, and Chomolungma (Mother Goddess of the Universe) in Tibetan.",
          "The trek from Jiri to Everest Base Camp begins by taking road transport from Kathmandu to Jiri (approximately 8 hours) from where the trail begins. Known as the ‘Classic Everest Trek’ this trek is great for people with plenty of time and also enables trekkers to acclimatize well to the altitude before climbing to the beautiful Everest viewpoint at Kalapatthar, which, at around 5,500m is the highest point of the trek.",
          "You need to be prepared to walk between 5 to 7 hours each day but there is plenty of time given to enjoy the views and take photographs. At the end of the trek, it is a short flight from Lukla Airport back to Kathmandu.",
          "The names Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa are familiar to everyone for their astonishing feat of being the first people to summit Everest. This fact alone has ensured that trekking to Everest Base Camp is high on the bucket list of serious trekkers and those who want to enjoy the rich environment of the mountains and mountain peoples of this region.",
          "The scenery on this trek is varied – from alpine forests, Sherpa villages, and yak pastures to glaciers, glacier-fed rivers crossed by amazing suspension bridges, and the bustling market town of Namche Bazaar.",
          "One of the highlights for many trekkers on this route is a visit to the famous Tengboche Monastery, which unfortunately suffered considerable damage during the April 2015 earthquake.",
          "But such is the power of this region that even this deadly natural disaster has a twist: just a few hours after the earthquake, the sons of both Sir Edmund and Tenzing Norgay literally came face to face with each other while seeking shelter. Both of them were, unknown to each other, guiding trekking groups near EBC when the earthquake hit.",
          "This unique, spiritual power that Everest seems to have is something that also draws people from all walks of life to this area, along with the stunning mountain views, spectacular and sometimes challenging terrain, and the beauty of the Sagarmatha National Park, home of the allusive snow leopard and red panda. Not for nothing has this area been included in the Sacred Himalayan Landscape initiative by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).",
          "And let’s not forget the magnificent mountain itself. In order to reach Everest Base Camp, the trail runs alongside the Khumbu Glacier, offering spectacular views of the Khumbu icefall and the route to the South Col. The aptly named Everest View Point at Kalapatthar offers you the best views of Mount Everest, as well as Mount Pumori and Ama Dablam."

Blessed with geographical, cultural and biological diversity, in this area there are not only hundreds of species of precious medicinal herbs, colourful wildflowers, and more than 200 species of birds, but it is a mining area for rubies and crystals. Nepal’s well-kept secret, this area is less-trekked than some other areas.",
          "Passing through four districts of Nepal, the route crosses Gorkha, the birthplace of modern Nepal. Here was the seat of King Prithivi Narayan Shah (1723 – 1775), who fought many wars to unify the country. This is also the homeland to the original Gurkhas. Today the area known as Ganesh Himal is home to a variety of peoples, mainly, Tamang, Gurung and Ghale in the north and Brahmin, Chhetri, Dalit, Newar and Chepang in the low elevation south.",
          "The trek takes in two passes as well as the Thulo Dhunga Base Camp from where waterfalls, rhododendron and juniper forests and lush vegetation can be seen.",
          "From the nearby Dobra Danda, the sight of the magnificent Ganesh Himal is spectacular and the small lakes of Kalo Kunda and Seto Kunda are unforgettable. Rubies are mined around the area of these lakes. The lakes themselves are thought to have mystical powers – being able to either bless or punish visitors.",
          "At the third, and holy lake of Ganesh Kunda, shamans gather in large numbers during September. The views from the passes include Langtang, Ganesh Himal and Manaslu ranges, thus combining mountain vistas with passing through culturally different villages and perhaps being entertaining with traditional music from the friendly peoples.",
          "The wildlife in this area is outstanding: musk deer, Jharal goats, wild boars, Langur monkeys, pheasants, and partridges included. And not forgetting the strange, reportedly, aphrodisiac, caterpillar-fungus, yarshagumba, which is harvested in the nearby highlands.",

          "Bimthang to Dharapani",
          "Dharapani to Kathmandu (Switch a bus in Beshi Sahar)",
          "We started at 6:30 am from Dhading Bus Park near Maccha Pokhari and stopped at mid-day for lunch near Kali Daha. On offer was a vegetarian dal bhat set for USD 1 and, for meat lovers, dal bhat with meat for USD 2. We reached Arukhet at 2:30 pm and waited for the local bus to Soti Khola, where we stayed in ABC Guest House.",
          "Chapati with peanut butter, perfect breakfast! Check Manaslu trek food. Then we moved on to Lapu Beshi, where we stopped for lunch. Here we found there are some alternative routes in use after the earthquake. We stayed in Tsum Valley Lodge & Restaurant that night.",
          "I was wondering what is the correct elevation of Maccha Khola. I saw two different signboards. At Diamir a sign displayed 900 meters and at Aktivferien a sign displayed 830 meters. I checked the elevation of Maccha Khola with my device, 870 meters! So on average, the elevation of Maccha Khola is 866.66 meters above sea level. I also discovered different versions of the trek map give different elevations of the places along the trail. Check Manaslu trek map.",
          "On our way to Jagat, we stopped in Dovan for lunch. The literal meaning of Dovan is a place where two rivers merge’. The local hotel owner fed us with dal bhat and fiddlehead fern. Not for the faint-hearted! We stayed in Jagat Guest House, at, guess where, Jagat! We tried to get a local chicken for dinner, but the owner asked for USD 26! We were ready to pay USD 24 but unfortunately for us, she refused.",
          "The next day we got lucky. An old lady sold us a chicken for USD 15. We brought the chicken to Philim and cooked it in Chisapani for lunch. At Deng there are only two teahouses, so we stayed in Windy Valley Lodge, run by Chandra Gurung, who also runs the Larke Rest House in Dharmasala. Nino, Karyn, and I suffered from diarrhea in Deng! Must have been that cheap chicken they said, but I thought it was the pumpkin pie. Actually, Nino ordered pumpkin pie for dessert, which was big enough to share among all of us. Nino bought additional toilet paper for USD 1.5 in Deng! Good man! I was wearing sandals and carrying heavy Scarpa boots in my backpack. After I started suffering from stomach problems I decided to wear my Scarpa.",
          "Gap is a regular lunch place between Deng and Namrung. There was a new teahouse on the right of the trail, without pumpkin pie, I hope. Before arriving in Namrung, there was a drastic change in the trail due to the earthquake. Now you need to climb an additional thirty minutes uphill and descend for ten minutes to arrive at Namrung. We stayed in Namrung Thakali Guest House, the first place that had Internet.",
          "A brand new Four Seasons resort was under construction in Namrung. Initially, we had planned to trek from Namrung to Sama Gaun in one day, but we decided to split this into two days, making it Namrung to Lho and Lho to Sama Gaun. As a result, we had to skip the side trip to the Tibetan border from Samdo. We stayed in the Majestic Cottage in Lho. There were three hammocks in the courtyard, which excited us! On the same day, there was a festival in Lho, a horse race. The weather didn’t permit the festival to run smoothly, however. It was raining and a bit windy. Weather cannot be predicted.",
          "Lho is a nice village. I recommend you to stay here for a day. You can watch sunset and sunrise over the Manaslu and explore the monastery.",
          "Lho to Sama Gaun was only about three hours walk, so we stopped in Shyala for tea. Sama Gaun is in the lap of Manaslu and has a primary school. Bir Bahadur Lama is the director of the school, and he also runs hotel Manaslu Hotel & Lodge. A small portion of your money at the hotel will go to school. This project is even supported by some organizations.",
          "You won’t find any lodge better than Manaslu Hotel and Lodge in Sama Gaun! A quality meal is guaranteed. Despite stomach problems, Nino ordered yak steak for dinner. All rooms were insulated, warm, and cozy. Thank you, Bir Bahadur Dai (brother), for your warm hospitality!",
          "On our acclimatization day, we went to Manaslu Base Camp. Birendra Lake was partially frozen. At the trail’s end, it gets technical, and we couldn’t make it all the way to base camp due to snow and ice. I checked the elevation, and we were at 4,470 meters. We had to climb approximately 50 meters to reach the real base camp. But it looked risky, so we turned back.",
          "I checked the weather forecast on the Internet. Yes, there was WiFi in the lodge. It showed that it would be snowing the next day when we were planning to cross the pass. I warned a few other groups who had just arrived at in Sama Gaun that they might have to return to Soti Khola.",
          "Some groups decided to stay in Sama, whereas some decided to skip the acclimatization day, and we hiked together to Samdo. We stayed in Tibetan Twin in Samdo. Personally, I do not recommend this hotel to anyone!",
          "Instead, go to Chez Karsang Lodge, the first hotel on your right-hand side. They can accommodate up to eighteen trekkers. Also, there is a good space for a camping group. Pasang Lama from Chez Karsang Lodge studies in grade one in Samdo Primary School. As she is really pretty and kind, I went there for some snacks! But she was shy and ran away when I tried to take her picture!",
          "I repeat, do not go to Tibetan Twin Hotel! The building had developed cracks on its walls after the quake. There were few skulls of blue sheep in Samdo.",
          "Nightmare! Dharmasala is the worst place to stay overnight on the entire Manaslu Trek. There would be no other options unless you chose to cross the pass starting from Samdo. By mid-afternoon, there were nine trekkers, approximately six guides and porters, and seven staff members in Dharmasala. Suddenly a swarming group of Spanish, Irish, and Italians arrived in Dharmasala. By the end of the day, there were twenty-two foreigners, eighteen guides and porters, and a group of six local trekkers, and everyone was worried about the upcoming weather.",
          "Nino was sick after his breakfast in Dharmasala. They didn’t want to sell a can of tuna! Why? We do not have enough stock, simply. The flow of tourists was low after the earthquake and fuel blockade, so they were not maintaining a proper stock. It is hard to supply goods, but they should have maintained a good stock of tinned items.",
          "We started very early in the morning. It was roughly 4:15 am. Larke Pass was easier going to the top but was more risky and dangerous while descending. I highly recommend a micro spike for Larke La.",
          "It took us eight and a half hours to reach Bimthang. Hotel Ponkar Mt. Inn is the place where we stayed. Locals from Tilije and Goa are running the hotel.",
          "It was raining while we were descending to Dharapani. The weather forecast was right. We stayed in The Seven Teahouse & Restaurant in Dharapani. This is very close to the checkpoint. Nino and Hayley were heading to the Annapurna Circuit. I made an exit permit for Karyn.",
          "The next morning we reserved a jeep to drive back to Beshi Sahar. We shared the jeep with a Spanish group. It took us almost six complete hours to drive to Beshi Sahar. Nino and Heyley continued toward Annapurna. From Beshi Sahar Ram, Deepak and I got a car back to Kathmandu. Actually, the car was there to drop off a client, so we paid USD 15 in total for three of us! Karyn went to Pokhara from Beshi Sahar with the Spanish group.",
          "I am now in a chair, soaking my feet in a bucket of hot water to cure my bad blisters! I have got antiseptic cream for it! Sometime in May, I will go to Kanchenjunga.",
          "Enjoy your trek! And once you are there, you will see why I talk a lot about food and accommodation!",
          "Namaste & Dhanyabad!"

          "Spend time around the Shey Phoksundo lake to breath its pristinity and the serene surrounding",
          "Opt for this trek in May and actively partake in the proceeding of the Tiji festival",
          "The Upper Dolpo to Upper Mustang trek takes in two remote areas which until relatively recently were closed to outsiders. These areas are unlike any other in Nepal, and can be compared in landscape and culture to Tibet or Ladakh in India. Indeed Dolpo lies between the Tibetan Plateau and the Dhaulagiri mountain ranges.",
          "This is a long (almost one month) and challenging trek. With most days spent at altitudes over 4,000m and some high passes over 5,000m a great deal of stamina and fitness is needed to complete this trek. It combines all the main points of Dolpo trekking, such as Phoksundo Lake; Shey Monastery; the Crystal Mountain; the Bon Po religion, and rare wildlife, such as the snow leopard, with the monasteries, stupas, people and history of the Forbidden Kingdom of Mustang.",
          "Both areas are unforgiving and yet people have lived there for centuries, trading goods along ancient salt trails, working what little fertile land there is by planting potatoes and barley and being self-sufficient. Mustang only officially became part of Nepal in the 1950s and until a few years back had its own king. Mustang is part of the recent turbulent history of Tibet: freedom fighters set up camps in Mustang from which to attack the Chinese troops.",
          "Starting in Dolpo, this trek passes through forests and remote villages to reach the clear, blue waters of Phoksundo Lake within the first few days. This lake was made famous, as indeed the whole of Dolpo was, in the Eric Valli film ‘Himalaya’. Shey Gompa is another famous landmark, and is often referred to as the spiritual heart of Dolpo. Situated at the base of the Crystal Mountain, it and the mountain attract hundreds of pilgrims each year.",
          "Within Upper Mustang, Lo-Manthang is the walled capital of the Kingdom of Lo. Although no longer the official king (his throne was lost when Nepal became a Republic in 2008), King, or Gyelpo Jigme Dorje Palbar Bista, still commands the respect and regard of the locals. It is in Lo-Manthang that the famous 3 day Tiji Festival is held every May or June. It is also in Mustang that the ‘sky caves’ or the Jhong Cave is found. Some 50 m up a cliff face, the Jhong Cave is thought to be over 800 years old.",
          "The Jhong Cave, which has five stories and 144 rooms, housed priceless wall paintings, centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist doctrine books, and human remains. It seems that there are hundreds of such caves in Upper Mustang, which appear to be dwellings of an ancient civilization. Set with the backdrop of the Annapurna mountains, Upper Mustang is a little explored yet unique place.",
          "This trek is definitely something special, especially for those who are interested in fascinating anthropology, mountain wildlife, and stunning scenery and who have a taste for adventure and the necessary time and fitness level."

Tigers do live here but are quite difficult to spot.",

Jeep and walking safaris are offered, and rafting on the river with perhaps fishing.   Nightlife here is more confined to your lodge.",

Currently, it does not see a lot of visitors but offers the same safari options of the jeep and walking safaris.  It is more difficult to get to than Chitwan and requires either a private vehicle or to be collected from the nearest big town by the lodge vehicle."

Jeep and walking safaris are offered, and rafting on the river with perhaps fishing.   Nightlife here is more confined to your lodge.",

Both these schools are in the more expensive price bracket.",

Here children learn in both English and French and it is somewhat less expensive than those mentioned above.",

This school is popular among the Christian mission community. Of course, there are other noteworthy schools in the Kathmandu Valley – Ullens and Ruby’s being just two of them. So the best thing to do would be to talk to other expat families and visit the schools to see which would be the best fit for your children.",

          "I recently returned from Nepal where I hiked the Manaslu circuit and a portion of the Annapurna circuit with a friend over eighteen days.",
          "After October & November, March & April is said to have the best hiking conditions. We started our trek in mid March and couldn’t have asked for better weather. At lower elevation, the days were warm and sunny, albeit hazy, and crystal clear at higher elevations. Of the eighteen days we hiked on both circuits we only experienced three days of rain.",
          "Both Annapurna and Manaslu were incredible experiences, however vastly different despite their neighboring positions. We chose to walk both routes in a counter-clockwise direction and since both circuits share the village of Dharapani we were able to combine the two into one big trek."
        ]

      {
        "section_header": "Overview of Manaslu Circuit trek",
        "section_content": [
          "We started with the Manaslu circuit and begin the trek in the town of Soti Khola. Traditionally trekkers begin in Arughat Bazaar but since the road continues to Soti Khola, we decided to begin there and eliminate the need to share the road with passing buses and motorbikes. We were able to complete the Circuit in eleven days working our way from an elevation of 775 m up to 5173 m (the highest point on Larke Pass) and then back down to 1800 m. We choose to stay in the following villages: Soti Khola, Maccha Khola, Jagat, Deng, Namrung, Lho, Sama Gaon (stayed here for an acclimatization day), Samdo, Dharmasala, Bimthang, and Dharapani.",
          "Government regulations require that tourists wishing to trek Manaslu hire a guide. We hired a guide for Manaslu but chose to walk Annapurna ourselves. While Annapurna was manageable on our own, we missed out on a lot of cultural experiences we would have otherwise had. Having a guide of Manaslu was a fantastic resource and truly went beyond information that can be gained from a book. We arranged a guide online through Magical Nepal and found he was a wealth of knowledge, spoke great English, and made our trip that much more enjoyable.",
          "Mt. Manaslu is the eighth highest mountain in the world and the circuit snakes it way up to and around the epic peak with your first glimpse of the mountain in the village of Lho. It rises up before you behind a monastery built up on a hill and is the most impressive sight. Approximately 5,000 people visit Manaslu each year, considerably less than the 35,000 that visit Annapurna and the 40,000 that visit Everest. As a result of this smaller number you are more likely to have the trail to yourself when hiking (yourself and the masses of mules carrying supplies between villages). Usually we would meet up with one or two other groups of two or three in the tea houses but for the most part saw no other foreigners. The circuit felt like truly authentic Himalayan experience, as there were no western toilets, very few locations with WiFi, and generator run electricity at best."

        "section_header": "How Manaslu is Different From Annapurna?",
        "section_content": [
          "Annapurna by comparison had slightly more dramatic landscapes and mountains however it had more of a “gringo trail” feel. It was incredible how easy to follow and accessible it was for foreigners to trek without the need for a guide, but with that came slightly less sense of adventure and resulted in spending more time with other westerners than locals. Not that this is a fault; it was enjoyable in its own regard, just a different experience.",
          "Additionally, Annapurna is accessible by road on both sides up to the towns of Jomsom (on the west side of Thorong La Pass) and Manang (on the east side of the pass) though it is possible at times to avoid walking on the road, which is dusty and polluted. The road has also increased the amenities locals are able to provide in their teahouses such as western toilets, and slightly more varied menus. Hot showers, electricity and WiFi are all easy to come by on Annapurna. After Manaslu our senses felt overwhelmed with western comforts and while we enjoyed the indulgence for the first few days we often reminisced about the quieter days on Manaslu.",
          "Each trek caters to different objectives. I highly recommend both for various reasons. Manaslu offers a more cultural and mentally taxing experience, while Annapurna has spectacular views and is a more comfortable trek for a less seasoned traveler. Both had plenty of highs and minimal lows, and neither would disappoint however each has the ability to cater more specifically to different trekkers desires."

Both lakes lie within national parks so the flora and fauna is as pristine as the waters are blue.  From Rara Lake it is a short 3 hour walk to the airstrip at Talcha from where a flight will take you back to Nepalgunj where you transfer to a flight heading to Kathmandu."

From here the trek enters Dunai, the district headquarters of Dolpo District where there is the first Bon school.  For those who do not know, the Bon religion pre-dates Buddhism and yet is quite similar in some ways. And yet Bon emphasises spirits and deities, unlike Buddhism which emphasises philosophy. One way to easily recognise practitioners of the Bon religion – who are known as Bonpo – is that they will walk anti-clockwise round shrines whereas Buddhists walk clockwise.  Bon also distinguishes itself from Buddhism on its interpretation of ancient teachings, religious dance forms, costumes and masks used during ceremonies and the patterns of religious paintings and statues. During this fascinating trek we will visit several Bon monasteries, Gompa and the Bon school as well as passing through three different districts of Nepal. The final, and exit point, being Mustang, trekkers also have the opportunity to visit Muktinath, a much revered Hindu temple with 108 water spouts and an un-dying flame."

In fact, some people only speak the dialect known as Kaike and which is only spoken in a small cluster of villages.  So isolated are the people in this area. You can feel something the hardship of life in this region as you cross the Mula Pass at 5,600m and follow some strenuous trails. This trek will be of much interest for those who love to learn about how other cultures live! Notice how the area feels, looks and sounds like its neighbour, Tibet.  Ending in Jomsom, the administrative capital of Mustang District, also notice how much busier and more prosperous the region of Mustang is compared to Dolpo. And how many more trekkers are on the trails! From Jomsom the flight takes you to Pokhara where you transit back to Kathmandu."

This valley is geographically aligned with Mt Kailash (holy to both Buddhists and Hindus), and it is from here it takes its name – Tise meaning Mt. Kailash in Tibetan.  Steeped in folk lore (for example it is believed if the Puta Glacier melts the whole universe will be destroyed), this is a trek that will introduce you to both Bon and Buddhist religions as well as Hindus and Shamans. For example, Chhyadul Gompa is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites in the Tichurong Valley.

It is a strenuous trek, however, in terms of both the trails and the altitude. Three nights are spent above 5,000m and the highest pass is Yeti La Pass at 5,720m which separates Upper Dolpo and Upper Mustang.  The trek ends at the famous Hindu pilgrim site of Muktinath before a short hike to Jomson and onward by flight to Pokhara and Kathmandu."

One of the highlights has to be the gorgeous Phoksundo Lake.  Here we take a day to acclimatize and explore the lake and surrounding forests before setting off along the Devil’s Trail over the Kang La Pass at 5,360m. Shey Gompa gives us an insight into the Buddhist religion which is prevalent in this area.  Mani walls (stone walls with Buddhist mantras carved into them), chorten (Buddhist shrines) and prayer flags fluttering in the wind bring to mind how strong the Buddhist philosophy and lifestyle is here. We also have the chance to marvel at the Crystal Mountain, so named because of the crystals and marine fossils found in its cliffs.  Passing through the valleys of Panzang and Charka the trail takes us across the Ghami La Pass to enter the once Forbidden Kingdom of Lo, or Upper Mustang.

Perhaps not but definitely you will meet interesting villagers from the picturesque village of Ringmo and practitioners of both the Bon and Buddhist religion.  Interestingly Bon pre-dates Buddhism and although fading out is very much alive in Dolpo. You will be passing through lower valleys inhabited by Magar people and higher valleys inhabited by people know as Dolpo Pa (literally Dolpo people).

The trek connects the Kanchenjunga region and Makalu region via the Lumba Sumba Pass, and runs through the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area and the Makalu Barun National Park in the eastern part of the country and can be done in one of two directions: starting in either Kanchenjunga or in Makalu.",
          "Highlights of this trek include the Lumba Sumba Peak (5,300m); spectacular Himalayan landscapes of the Makalu and Kanchenjunga ranges; different ethnic villages (Limbu, Sherpa, Rai, Gurung, Tamang); cultural heritage; endangered wild life such as the snow leopard and red panda; the base camps of Mount Kanchenjunga and Mount Makalu, and major river systems. With the huge variety of landscapes and natural beauty, and its sometimes harsh and less than good condition trails, it is no surprise that this is a strenuous trek, therefore it is recommended people tackling this trek have prior experience.",
          "While the majority of the trek passes through scattered pockets of human habitation in the form of villages, monasteries, markets and schools, there are days when trekkers are completely alone in the wilderness, particularly on the most difficult day – when they cross through the Lumba Sumba Pass. In order to cross the pass, the day starts very early as after noon, due to weather conditions, it is difficult to cross.",
          "During these days off the beaten track there has been sightings of snow leopards, which would certainly add a new excitement to the journey! After crossing the pass, while hiking through the Arun Valley, there is opportunity for bird watchers to spot several unique and rare species. This is the ideal trek to enjoy spectacular mountain views and learn something about village life in eastern Nepal, throwing in a cultural mix of chortens, temples, monasteries and prayer wheels."

          "The Lumba Sumba Pass trek was only opened in 2012 so it is a relatively unknown trek. The trek connects the Kanchenjunga region and Makalu region via the Lumba Sumba Pass, and runs through the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area and the Makalu Barun National Park in the eastern part of the country and can be done in one of two directions: starting in either Kanchenjunga or in Makalu.",
          "Highlights of this trek include the Lumba Sumba Peak (5,300m); spectacular Himalayan landscapes of the Makalu and Kanchenjunga ranges; different ethnic villages (Limbu, Sherpa, Rai, Gurung, Tamang); cultural heritage; endangered wild life such as the snow leopard and red panda; the base camps of Mount Kanchenjunga and Mount Makalu, and major river systems. With the huge variety of landscapes and natural beauty, and its sometimes harsh and less than good condition trails, it is no surprise that this is a strenuous trek, therefore it is recommended people tackling this trek have prior experience.",
          "While the majority of the trek passes through scattered pockets of human habitation in the form of villages, monasteries, markets and schools, there are days when trekkers are completely alone in the wilderness, particularly on the most difficult day – when they cross through the Lumba Sumba Pass. In order to cross the pass, the day starts very early as after noon, due to weather conditions, it is difficult to cross.",
          "During these days off the beaten track there has been sightings of snow leopards, which would certainly add a new excitement to the journey! After crossing the pass, while hiking through the Arun Valley, there is opportunity for bird watchers to spot several unique and rare species. This is the ideal trek to enjoy spectacular mountain views and learn something about village life in eastern Nepal, throwing in a cultural mix of chortens, temples, monasteries and prayer wheels."

Crossing two passes – the French Pass at 5,360m and Dhampus Pass at 5,200m, and including the Dhaulagiri Base Camp at 4,740m, this is a challenging trek which requires a high level of fitness. However, with good stamina and basic mountaineering skills, the rewards of this trek include stunning views of Tukuche Peak (6,920m), Dhaulagiri I (8,167m), Dhaulagiri ii (7,751m), Dhaulagiri III (7,715m) and Dhaulagiri V (7,618m).",
          "Dhaulagiri rises above the deepest gorge in the world, the Kali Gandaki, and the circuit route provides stunning views of the whole Dhaulagiri range. Discovered in 1808, standing at 8,167m, Dhaulagiri was thought to be the highest mountain in the world until 30 years later when Kanchenjunga took that honour; later to be taken away by Mount Everest!   The Dhaulagiri Circuit route was discovered in the 1950s by a French team, hence the French Pass, which leads into a lonely area known as Hidden Valley.",
          "The circuit trail makes its way through villages and terraced farm land, along rivers and gorges, and along glaciers and moraine. With time to acclimatize before tackling the high passes there is plenty of opportunity to take in the magnificent mountain vistas."

          "The Dhaulagiri Circuit trek is a long trek that passes through high alpine pastures, uninhabited valleys, high windswept passes, forests and cultivated terraced hills. Crossing two passes – the French Pass at 5,360m and Dhampus Pass at 5,200m, and including the Dhaulagiri Base Camp at 4,740m, this is a challenging trek which requires a high level of fitness. However, with good stamina and basic mountaineering skills, the rewards of this trek include stunning views of Tukuche Peak (6,920m), Dhaulagiri I (8,167m), Dhaulagiri ii (7,751m), Dhaulagiri III (7,715m) and Dhaulagiri V (7,618m).",
          "Dhaulagiri rises above the deepest gorge in the world, the Kali Gandaki, and the circuit route provides stunning views of the whole Dhaulagiri range. Discovered in 1808, standing at 8,167m, Dhaulagiri was thought to be the highest mountain in the world until 30 years later when Kanchenjunga took that honour; later to be taken away by Mount Everest!   The Dhaulagiri Circuit route was discovered in the 1950s by a French team, hence the French Pass, which leads into a lonely area known as Hidden Valley.",
          "The circuit trail makes its way through villages and terraced farm land, along rivers and gorges, and along glaciers and moraine. With time to acclimatize before tackling the high passes there is plenty of opportunity to take in the magnificent mountain vistas."

          "At the end of the dry season, there is an ancient, three-day festival celebrated annually in the walled city of Lo Manthang.

          "Even getting to the trailhead takes two flights. The first from Kathmandu to Pokhara and then a second from Pokhara to Jomsom. Trekking is moderate though with good teahouse options over the 10 days it takes to get to Lo Manthang.",
          "Permits are expensive as you need a restricted area permit (currently 500USD) as well as an Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (20 USD). But Tiji is unique and every person who experiences it can only agree with Michel Peisell’s quote.",
          "Every year Magical Nepal will be arranging a special Tiji festival trek. If you are after an unforgettable experience, please contact us for more details."

If you have Alpine PD+/ AD route experience (or have climbed Scottish Grade I/II winter routes) you will enjoy your climb on Himlung better. This is not a very technically difficult climb but it is physically demanding and takes 10 to 15 days to conquer the summit from base camp and back. The whole trip is 27 days, Kathmandu to Kathmandu, which includes 15 days for the climb.",

The first two days are by road. Then from Koto we trek in for 5 days, including an acclimatization day. After breaking away from the trekking route, the landscape turns barren and other-worldly.",

This trek combines cross-country trekking with mountaineering (fixed ropes and possible ice axe) to scale the high passes of the “Three Cols” – namely Sherpani Col, West Col, and Amphu Labsta. Today this trek forms part of the Great Himalayan Trail, a newly opened up trail that crosses the country from east to west through some of the toughest and most beautiful landscapes.",

          "The latter section of the trek follows the route to Everest Base Camp, from where mountaineering expeditions set off to scale Everest. The trek also visits Gorakshep and Kala Patthar, the viewpoint for Everest, from where the views of the world’s tallest mountain are simply stunning! The Makalu Barun region is one of the largest protected areas in Nepal, home to 3,000 species of flowering plants, including a variety of Himalayan orchids, 440 species of birds, and 75 species of mammals. Rare species such as the snow leopard, musk deer, and Himalayan Thar live in this pristine environment. This is one of the reasons it has been included in the Sacred Himalayan Landscape initiative of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).",
          "And not forgetting the once-in-a-lifetime views of the immense mountain vistas of Makalu (8,481m), Everest (8,848m), and Lhotse (8,516m) – which are towering granite cliffs capped with amazing glaciers, and high altitude lakes. This is a journey for those who have the stamina and fitness level to tackle one of the most rewarding and challenging treks in Nepal.

          "The Sherpani Col Pass Trek includes three passes, two of them over 6,000m. It traverses the mountain range between Makalu and Everest. This trek combines cross-country trekking with mountaineering (fixed ropes and possible ice axe) to scale the high passes of the “Three Cols” – namely Sherpani Col, West Col, and Amphu Labsta. Today this trek forms part of the Great Himalayan Trail, a newly opened up trail that crosses the country from east to west through some of the toughest and most beautiful landscapes.",
          "This being one of the most challenging sections of the Great Himalaya Trail, an excellent level of fitness is required to complete the long weeks of trekking, the majority of days at altitudes over 4,000 and up to 6,000m.",
          "The latter section of the trek follows the route to Everest Base Camp, from where mountaineering expeditions set off to scale Everest. The trek also visits Gorakshep and Kala Patthar, the viewpoint for Everest, from where the views of the world’s tallest mountain are simply stunning! The Makalu Barun region is one of the largest protected areas in Nepal, home to 3,000 species of flowering plants, including a variety of Himalayan orchids, 440 species of birds, and 75 species of mammals. Rare species such as the snow leopard, musk deer, and Himalayan Thar live in this pristine environment. This is one of the reasons it has been included in the Sacred Himalayan Landscape initiative of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).",
          "And not forgetting the once-in-a-lifetime views of the immense mountain vistas of Makalu (8,481m), Everest (8,848m), and Lhotse (8,516m) – which are towering granite cliffs capped with amazing glaciers, and high altitude lakes. This is a journey for those who have the stamina and fitness level to tackle one of the most rewarding and challenging treks in Nepal. The final days of this amazing trip are spent in Namche Bazaar and Lukla – and that’s just the icing on the cake (Or the snow on the glacier!)."

          "The passes themselves are not very high as passes in the Himalayas go! Sing La and Pang Sang are traversed on the same day. The views from the passes include Langtang, Ganesh Himal, and Manaslu ranges, with just a touch of the Annapurna.",
          "The final pass, Magne Goth leads, the following day, to Ganga and Jamuna. It is interesting that these names belong to Hindu twin goddesses and are usually given to twin girls (twins not being very usual in Nepal).",
          "Thousands of devotees make a pilgrimage to the temple here, particularly on the Purnima and Makar Sakranti festivals. Devotees believe your desires will be fulfilled if you visit this temple.",
          "Blessed with geographical, cultural, and biological diversity, in this area, there are not only hundreds of species of precious medicinal herbs but also rubies and crystals!",
          "Around Hindung village is an area where crystals and rubies are mined, while in the surrounding highlands yarsagumba is harvested. Yarsagumba is a unique caterpillar-fungus fusion that occurs when parasitic mushroom spores infect and mummify a ghost moth larva living in the soil. A spindly fungus later sprouts from the dead caterpillar host’s head.",
          "It is sought after, particularly in Tibet, as an aphrodisiac. Rubies are also mined around the area of the Kalo and Seto lakes, which are also thought to have mystical powers – being able to either bless or punish visitors. At the holy lake of Ganesh Kunda, shamans gather in large numbers during September.",
          "This 16 days trek has a bit of everything from crossing Himalayan passes with stunning mountain views; learning about the culture and traditions, both Hindu and Buddhist of the surrounding area, and visiting magical lakes and waterfalls. It is a paradise for those who want to see the alternative trekking region of Nepal."

          "Witness the spectacular views of Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapucchre and Manaslu",
          "You will have an amazing encounter with the descendants of the Tibetan people at Lo Manthang",
          "The Nar Phu Teri La Pass Upper Mustang trek can be done in either direction but for better acclimatisation it is advisable to trek as it says: Manang (where Nar and Phu are located) to Mustang. This trek visits the fort-like village of Phu and its neighbor, Nar; crosses the Teri La Pass (5,595m), and enters the ancient forbidden Kingdom of Lo or Upper Mustang as it is more commonly known.",
          "This expedition-style trek takes three weeks, with an average of 5 to 6 hours of walking each day. It passes through areas with no or very little human settlement and requires a high level of fitness and stamina. Previous hiking experience is recommended.",
          "Phu village sits high on a hill at the intersection of many glacier valleys, surrounded by majestic Himalayan peaks. Nar is a slightly more modern village, but both are inhabited by people who are Tibetan-like and in the past would have been traders along the old salt route to Tibet. More Tibetan-like settlements can be seen in Upper Mustang: indeed many of the inhabitants would have come originally from Tibet. In order to get to Upper Mustang, itself situated on the border with Tibet, the trail crosses the Teri La Pass at 5,595m with views of the Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapucchre and Manaslu.",
          "The religious and spiritual heart of Upper Mustang is Lo Manthang (4,840m), the ancient centre and home of the King of Lo. The King of Lo ruled until 2008 when the Nepal Government outlawed all monarchies in the country. Being Buddhist people, there are wonderful monasteries, and even ancient sky caves in this area.",
          "Some caves are 50m up the cliff face and housed wall paintings, religious texts and human remains when recently discovered. These kinds of findings and the surrounding arid desert-like cliffs give Upper Mustang an almost surreal feeling. Then, continuing down the Kali Gandaki Gorge, the deepest gorge in the world, the trail passes the interesting village of Kagbeni and on to the market town and transportation hub of Jomsom.",
          "On this often an isolated trek, it is not hard to imagine what the traders of old felt when travelling through the rocky river beds, or along high trails overlooking a deep gorge, passing yak pastures and windswept landscapes. And like the traders of old, trekkers should be prepared for strenuous hiking!"

          "Witness the spectacular views of Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapucchre and Manaslu",
          "You will have an amazing encounter with the descendants of the Tibetan people at Lo Manthang",
          "The Nar Phu Teri La Pass Upper Mustang trek can be done in either direction but for better acclimatisation it is advisable to trek as it says: Manang (where Nar and Phu are located) to Mustang. This trek visits the fort-like village of Phu and its neighbor, Nar; crosses the Teri La Pass (5,595m), and enters the ancient forbidden Kingdom of Lo or Upper Mustang as it is more commonly known.",
          "This expedition-style trek takes three weeks, with an average of 5 to 6 hours of walking each day. It passes through areas with no or very little human settlement and requires a high level of fitness and stamina. Previous hiking experience is recommended.",
          "Phu village sits high on a hill at the intersection of many glacier valleys, surrounded by majestic Himalayan peaks. Nar is a slightly more modern village, but both are inhabited by people who are Tibetan-like and in the past would have been traders along the old salt route to Tibet. More Tibetan-like settlements can be seen in Upper Mustang: indeed many of the inhabitants would have come originally from Tibet. In order to get to Upper Mustang, itself situated on the border with Tibet, the trail crosses the Teri La Pass at 5,595m with views of the Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapucchre and Manaslu.",
          "The religious and spiritual heart of Upper Mustang is Lo Manthang (4,840m), the ancient centre and home of the King of Lo. The King of Lo ruled until 2008 when the Nepal Government outlawed all monarchies in the country. Being Buddhist people, there are wonderful monasteries, and even ancient sky caves in this area.",
          "Some caves are 50m up the cliff face and housed wall paintings, religious texts and human remains when recently discovered. These kinds of findings and the surrounding arid desert-like cliffs give Upper Mustang an almost surreal feeling. Then, continuing down the Kali Gandaki Gorge, the deepest gorge in the world, the trail passes the interesting village of Kagbeni and on to the market town and transportation hub of Jomsom.",
          "On this often an isolated trek, it is not hard to imagine what the traders of old felt when travelling through the rocky river beds, or along high trails overlooking a deep gorge, passing yak pastures and windswept landscapes. And like the traders of old, trekkers should be prepared for strenuous hiking!"

In the UN and larger INGOs local staff are pretty familiar with the ways of expats and are obliging and hard working. Perhaps not so much in smaller office, NGOs or private organisations. Be patient when things seem to be taking too long; try not to lose your temper when things go wrong, and respect the fact that in the field Nepalis will have a better understanding of how to approach community members etc. But don’t let your professionalism be undermined.",
          "If you have household staff you may have ‘inherited’ them from your predecessor or they may have worked for expats in the past. On the whole these staff members will be familiar with the odd behaviour of expat families! If your staff have not worked for expats before, your work may be cut out for you in training them in hygiene and cleanliness, particularly important if you have young children.",
          "We receive great feedback from families who have nannies – all Nepalis love children! Ask you colleagues and friends for the current staff salary rates, bearing in mind that INGO staff tend to pay their staff very highly when compared to long term expats or locals. As a rough guide, a 9 to 5 housekeeper who works 5 days a week might receive a salary of Rs15-20,000 a month from an expat family but will only expect to receive around Rs3,000 from a local family.",
          "Don’t pay over the going rate but do expect to pay more for your staff than a local family does. Guards/ gatemen can be hired individually or through a registered company. You will pay more through a company but then you don’t need to worry about what to do when it’s the guards day off, or if he is sick or when its his vacation time.",
          "All staff, office, household, gardeners etc., will expect (and it’s the country norm) another month’s salary during the main festival time of Dashain/ Tihar. They will also expect around 15 days off during this time. However, it is not normal for Nepalis to take vacations at other times of the year.",
          "What is expected is a long period of time off (up to 15 days) when a close relative dies.",
          "If you are single you might be thinking of romance! Nepali people in general are very easy to fall in love with! For expat women, finding a guy is not a big problem (although finding a ‘genuine’ one might be more of a challenge). For expat men it is much harder as even working women cannot come out in the evenings (family rules and obligations). Everyone should be aware that expats are often seen as a bit of a ‘meal ticket’ or visa out of the country. Not that this should stop you making friends, just be a bit aware. Additionally, when a Nepali professes love, it might not have the same meaning as in the West. In a country where arranged marriages are still the norm, expectations from a relationship are different and what seems all very romantic today may be a tough road of Nepali family obligations in the future.",
          "Learning the language will go a long way towards better cross-cultural communication. But not all of us are naturals at language. But the basics will definitely help in day-to-day life."

          "Having lived in a remote area of Nepal for five years, when I moved to Kathmandu in 2000 it was good to have access to something of a ‘nightlife’ again! However, Kathmandu of the early 2000’s was very different from today. The Maoist/ Government conflict reached its peak around 2001, particularly after the Royal Family was massacred in June 2001, and there were a lot of curfews and restrictions at that time.",
          "Although Thamel has been around for decades, there were less bars and clubs back then. In general, I remember having to go to the big, 4 star hotels which would periodically hold DJ parties with Bollywood and Western music. Those were fun nights with everyone coming together with one mind.",
          "Probably it was around the mid 2000’s (the conflict ended in 2006) that more music venues and clubs started to appear in Thamel and nearby. The one I frequented the most was the Irish Bar in Lazimpat which was a late night venue with live music two or three times a week. The atmosphere was still very friendly and it felt like a close knit community of music lovers of different ages.",
          "In the early 2000s also came the first Jazzmandu Festival. That was something very new and special for Nepal! I would say for the first 2 or 3 years of this annual festival, mainly expats attended. There was already a jazz bar in Lazimpat (Jazz Upstairs, which still exists) and the owner of that bar and the drummer of the only jazz band in town were the ones who started the festival. In 2007 the Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory opened up and changed the music scene in Kathmandu forever!",

          "Also, as time went on, with the introduction of bigger and more fancy clubs and with the end of the conflict and with tourists coming back to the country again things changed quite a bit. Clubs became more exclusive and the atmosphere became less family like and more competitive – clothes, ability to spend money, etc.",
          "Periodically the police decide that we all should get a good night’s sleep and close things down at 10 or 11pm. At the end of 2015 it was decided that Thamel could stay open 24 hours. Great timing – winter season, so less tourists, locals not coming out due to cold and a fuel shortage! However, right on form, this policy was cancelled in time for the 2016 spring tourist season when they announced music should end at 10pm. At the time of writing, however, most of the bars are opened till 12 or 1 am. And clubs are open to 2 or 3 am.",

          "Altitude sickness happens when you cannot get enough oxygen from the air at high altitude. Most often this is because people who are not used to high altitude go up too quickly.",
          "2. At what height can you get altitude sickness?",
          "Altitude sickness can even happen as low as 2,500m – but that would be mild. More usually, symptoms may appear at altitudes of 3,500m and above.",
          "3. What does high altitude do to your body?",
          "After humans reach the height of around 2,100m, the amount of oxyhemoglobin saturation in the blood begins to plummet. In other words, the amount of oxygen in the blood is reduced.",
          "4. What are the symptoms of altitude sickness?",

          "Yes! But if caught in time, after 2 or 3 days at a lower altitude, most people make a full recovery!",
          "6. What is HACE?",
          "High altitude cerebral edema is a medical condition where the brain swells with fluid because of the physiological effect of travelling to a high altitude. It generally appears in patients who have acute mountain sickness. Symptoms include disorientation, lethargy and nausea, among others.",
          "7. Am I at risk of altitude sickness?",
          "There is no knowing who will suffer from altitude sickness. It does not follow that the younger and fitter people will not get altitude sickness where the older and less fit will. It is not related to (general) fitness or age.",
          "8. Then, how do I avoid altitude sickness?",
          "To prevent altitude sickness proper acclimatization is needed at 2,500 and above. Ascending slowly will give your body time to adapt to the change in altitude. If trekking alone – always give yourself an extra two or three days to acclimatize. For those trekking with a registered company, acclimatization days will have already been built into your trip.",
          "9. Is there anyone way to avoid altitude sickness?",
          "Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, and eat enough food. Avoid alcohol, especially in the first two days at high altitude. There are also medicines such as Diamox which can be taken to prevent altitude sickness. Consult your doctor before leaving home.",
          "10. Am I likely to get altitude sickness on my trek?",

Certainly, that doesn’t mean you need to just stay in your hotel – taking a trip to Khumjung and Khunde, which are at a higher altitude, is not only interesting but gets your body used to both hiking and the high altitude. As you will, most likely, be coming back down to Namche to sleep, that is ideal. Trek high, sleep low.",
          "Most trekkers then head to Tengboche Monastery for the spectacular views. Remember that’s an increase of over 1,000 metres in one day. And again, the next day to Dingboche another 400 metres. It is recommended that everyone takes another acclimatization day at Dingboche (4,400m). Again, hiking to Chukung or Nagarjun Hill is a good idea to get used to the high altitude, particularly as Nagarjun Hill is at 5,000m. Again, trek high, sleep low.",
          "For those going on to Everest Base Camp where the viewpoint Kalapatthar is at 5,500m or who are going on over some of the high passes, also around the same elevation, please be especially careful when trekking without a registered guide/ trekking company (who will be keeping an experienced eye on the health of clients).",
          "To sum up, anyone can suffer from altitude sickness. It is not a reflection of your overall fitness. In fact it is often the young and ‘fitter’ trekkers who suffer more as try to ascend too fast, walk too quickly and often ignore what their body is telling them. But if you acclimatize well and remember the golden rules, you will be fine!",

As Bill Tilman, a British mountaineer and travel writer quotes ‘one of the world’s most beautiful valleys’, Langtang valley is a serene landscape on the lap of Himalayas.",
          "On this Langtang trek, you get to explore the amazing bond of the Tibetan-influenced culture and the crisp mountainside sceneries. On walking through the valley the hospitality of Tamang people and the architectural beauty of monasteries will entice you. And, the lush rhododendron forests on the backdrop of mesmerizing sight of the Himalayas will accompany you all along the trek.",
          "The earthquake of April 2015 had a devastating effect on the Langtang valley. It not only caused the loss of many lives but also destroyed parts of the trekking trail. It led to the closing of the trekking valley for some time. But, the valley is now restored and safe for trekking. You will find new trails for the ones that destroyed with the preservation of its natural beauty.",
          "And, different teahouses are re-built with earthquake-resistant technologies and the number is also increased. So, you will have a much easy time finding a safe place to spend the night. After the reconstruction of the village and the trails, it is a safer place for the trekking enthusiasts."

          "Your trekking route starts after you reach Syabrubesi which is at an altitude of 1550m. On your first day, some parts of the trail are steep but the walk on this day is easy. You will gain an altitude of 800m after walking 7-8 hours to reach Lama Hotel, 2560m.",

On this day, you will walk past water mills, inscription carved stones, the largest mani wall in Nepal etc.",
          "On the second and third day, you will mostly be climbing uphill, so walk on your own pace to make it easy. Drink plenty of water throughout your trek so that your body is not dehydrated. Dehydration will make you weak and make the climb even more difficult. It also increases the risks of altitude sickness. So, do not forget to fill your water bottle with safe water.",
          "After the third day, you will be walking downhill up to Lama Hotel. Your knees will feel a lot of pressure. Please wear your kneecaps and use your trekking poles on this day. You need to walk properly as you will be walking 6-7 hours down a steep trail.",
          "Some parts of the Langtang valley trek are quite tougher with the difficult slopes and rocky path. At such points, you must walk slowly and carefully. Rest of the trekking trails are quite easy with the enticing nature views on your side."

So, if there is a heavy inflow of the trekkers in the region then you may face difficulty in finding rooms and you may have to adjust the room with the fellow trekkers. Plus, if you love solitude, then you may feel the trails quite crowded in the peak season.",

          "The Upper Dolpo to Rara Traverse trek highlights two of the most beautiful high altitude lakes in Nepal. Starting in the barren yet stunningly beautiful landscape of Dolpo, and ending in the equally beautiful Mugu district, one of the poorest areas of the country, this trek is as challenging as it is enthralling. Spread over three weeks, there are four high passes to cross as well as high, steep, narrow and rocky trails to negotiate. A good deal of this trek is done at over 4,000m with the passes being between 5,000 to 5,500m. The lakes themselves Phoksundo (3,641m) in Dolpo and Rara (2,980m) in Mugu are both turquoise jewels set in a craggy, rocky landscape, and in pine forests, respectively. On the way the route, part of the newly opened east to west Great Himalayan Trail (GHT), passes through interesting villages with a Buddhist culture closely linked to Tibet, monasteries and gompa, and the quartz studded Crystal Mountain.",
          "Dolpo is an area where the Bon Po religion (similar but different to Tibetan Buddhism) is still practiced and the majority of the people are more closely tied to Tibet than Nepal. Trade routes along which yaks and mules pass still run from Tibet to the lower parts of Nepal. Shey Gompa, a 12th century monastery, is often referred to as the spiritual heart of Dolpo, and is situated at the base of the Crystal Mountain, a long-standing pilgrimage area.",
          "Mugu is the least developed district of Nepal, where its rugged landscape has meant it remains pretty much as it was in the past. With the opening of the GHT and a push towards local tourism, the beautiful Rara Lake, Nepal’s largest, is making its way onto the map. Rara National Park is the smallest national park in Nepal at only 106 square kilometers. As in the Shey Phoksundo National Park (3,55km2) which covers a large portion of Dolpo, there are several interesting mammal species in Rara National Park including the snow leopard, red panda, Himalayan black bear, musk deer, Langur and rhesus monkeys, among others.",

          "The Upper Dolpo to Rara Traverse trek highlights two of the most beautiful high altitude lakes in Nepal. Starting in the barren yet stunningly beautiful landscape of Dolpo, and ending in the equally beautiful Mugu district, one of the poorest areas of the country, this trek is as challenging as it is enthralling. Spread over three weeks, there are four high passes to cross as well as high, steep, narrow and rocky trails to negotiate. A good deal of this trek is done at over 4,000m with the passes being between 5,000 to 5,500m. The lakes themselves Phoksundo (3,641m) in Dolpo and Rara (2,980m) in Mugu are both turquoise jewels set in a craggy, rocky landscape, and in pine forests, respectively. On the way the route, part of the newly opened east to west Great Himalayan Trail (GHT), passes through interesting villages with a Buddhist culture closely linked to Tibet, monasteries and gompa, and the quartz studded Crystal Mountain.",
          "Dolpo is an area where the Bon Po religion (similar but different to Tibetan Buddhism) is still practiced and the majority of the people are more closely tied to Tibet than Nepal. Trade routes along which yaks and mules pass still run from Tibet to the lower parts of Nepal. Shey Gompa, a 12th century monastery, is often referred to as the spiritual heart of Dolpo, and is situated at the base of the Crystal Mountain, a long-standing pilgrimage area.",
          "Mugu is the least developed district of Nepal, where its rugged landscape has meant it remains pretty much as it was in the past. With the opening of the GHT and a push towards local tourism, the beautiful Rara Lake, Nepal’s largest, is making its way onto the map. Rara National Park is the smallest national park in Nepal at only 106 square kilometers. As in the Shey Phoksundo National Park (3,55km2) which covers a large portion of Dolpo, there are several interesting mammal species in Rara National Park including the snow leopard, red panda, Himalayan black bear, musk deer, Langur and rhesus monkeys, among others.",

This mysterious land has a dry atmosphere and is at high altitude, despite being in ‘lower’ Dolpo. With ever increasing altitudes up to the maximum 5,190m and with days averaging 6 – 7 hours of walking, this two week trek is recommended for experienced and fit hikers. But the rewards are astounding: the crisp, clear blueness of Phoksundo Lake (3,611m); unique flora and fauna; a unique religion; diverse culture; colourful festivals; challenging passes; high snow-covered Kanjirowa Himal peaks and the list goes on!",

Additionally, this is one of the few remaining places where the Bon Po religion is practiced. Bon Po is similar and yet different from Buddhism – one difference being practitioners walk anti-clockwise round stupas and shrines.",

But most probably, people recognise this lake from the film which was made here about, and staring, the people of this area. Known as Caravan in Nepal, the film was called Himalaya on the international stage.",
          "Naturally there is a reason why this area is remote and isolated – difficult and rough, and at times very high and narrow, paths and mountain passes over 5,000m. But for those who have an interest in the Buddhist and Bon Po culture, are excited by windswept scenery interspersed with pine forests and the possibility of sighting rare mammal and medicinal plant species, this is a truly wonderful trek!"

On the return journey trekkers cross the Tutu La Pass (4,125m) which is now known by the name of Shipton’s Pass.",
          "The Shipton Pass is named after the renowned mountaineer Eric Shipton who was involved with most expeditions to Mount Everest in the 1930’s and who, in 1951, was part of the team that mapped out the now famous route over the Khumbu Glacier.",
          "The Makalu Barun National Park is home to 3,000 species of flowering plants, 440 species of birds and 75 species of mammals including the snow leopard, red panda, musk dear, wild boar, wild yak and the Himalayan Thar. With the possibility of spotting wildlife at lower altitudes, green pastures and fields, villages, and forests, combined with snow-capped mountains, glaciers and rocky trails, this is also ideal photography territory!"

On the return journey trekkers cross the Tutu La Pass (4,125m) which is now known by the name of Shipton’s Pass.",
          "The Shipton Pass is named after the renowned mountaineer Eric Shipton who was involved with most expeditions to Mount Everest in the 1930’s and who, in 1951, was part of the team that mapped out the now famous route over the Khumbu Glacier.",
          "The Makalu Barun National Park is home to 3,000 species of flowering plants, 440 species of birds and 75 species of mammals including the snow leopard, red panda, musk dear, wild boar, wild yak and the Himalayan Thar. With the possibility of spotting wildlife at lower altitudes, green pastures and fields, villages, and forests, combined with snow-capped mountains, glaciers and rocky trails, this is also ideal photography territory!"

          "Taplejung is the starting point of the trek (north to south), but before Taplejung you might end up sleeping in Birtamod or Ilam for a night, and revisiting these towns at the end of your trek. Check the options for getting to Taplejung from Kathmandu. In both towns can choose a hotel out of many, ranging from normal to deluxe rooms. In Taplejung also you can choose among many. I stayed in the Pathivara Guest House paying Rs 400 for a normal room. You can upgrade to a room with an attached bathroom with a hot shower at the cost of Rs 600.",
          "In Chirwa we paid Rs 200 per person for a nights stay. Basically then, Rs 200 for a single room, Rs 400 for a double and Rs 600 for a triple. There are only two teahouses in Chirwa. The one we stayed at was just next to the Tamang Guest House and has three double bedrooms and one triple room.",
          "We did not go to Lelep, a big village with only one hotel around the same price as in Chirwa.",
          "In Sekathum there is only one hotel, but you can walk 10 minutes down the road to Japantar where there is another teahouse with accommodation. Both places charge Rs 200 per person and have four double bedrooms.",
          "In Amjilosa there are two teahouses. The first one on the left above the road is new and very nice. Down the road there is a guesthouse owned by Lakpa and it is always noisy. The owner starts drinking from early morning and fights with his wife. In Amjilosa we stayed in Chiring Kipa Guest House, the first one above the trail. Newly built, the price is Rs 200 per person. They have six double rooms.",
          "Ghunsa has around nine guesthouses. We stayed in Peaceful Guest House, in really nice rooms, for the same Rs 200 per person. They have two four-bed rooms, two single rooms and two triple rooms.",
          "Khambachen is a small yak pasture settlement with three teahouses. Forget the rest if the Khambachen White Horse Guest House is open. This is the best teahouse among the trail with Norbu being the best cook. They also have a food menu! Check Kanchenjunga trek food. The room price is Rs 800 for a triple room. The room’s walls were covered with beautiful curtains and the whole guesthouse was neat and clean. Definitely the best rooms on the Kanchenjunga trail. They have one triple room, seven double rooms and one single room.",
          "Lhonak can be a perfect place for camping! It is a small yak pasture with a few huts. Lhonak Guest House (Lhonak Guest House) is on right hand side, and is highly recommended. They have nice rooms and solar lights, which others do not have. The mattresses are thick and if the blankets are not enough, they will give you more. The room prices are slightly more expensive but it is same price everywhere in Lhonak. Per person the cost is Rs 500! They do not have any toilet in Lhonak, even in this guesthouse. Lhonak Guest House has four double bed rooms.",
          "We didn’t stay overnight in Pangpema. There is a very small basic hut in Pangpema. If it is open and you want to stay there overnight, probably the cost is similar to Lhonak, i.e. Rs 500 per person. They also do not have a toilet. I don’t recommend staying in Pangpema. See the most recommend itinerary on basis of my recent Kanchenjunga trek north to south in May 2016.",
          "Sele Le Pass Camp is very similar to Pangpema! One small hut, but it is bigger than Pangpema with five rooms. Again no toilet, and again Rs 500 per person, no discount!",
          "Cheram is a good place to stay. There are two established hotels and one is under construction. We stayed in Yalung Kang Guest House. They have two double and one triple room. By September 2016 they will have eleven rooms in total and a telephone and gas shower. It is Rs 800 for the triple room.",
          "Ramche is a last hotel on the Kanchenjunga south side. It was closed when we were there. I think it will be the same as Sele Le because it is made of stonewall, so mostly it will be freezing cold. You can avoid staying there by making a day trip to the south base camp from Cheram. Read my day trip experience. I didn’t check the price in Ramche for accommodation.",
          "Anda Phedi is on an alternative route from Sele Le Pass instead of Cheram. There is only one guesthouse. We didn’t stop there but the price should be same as Cheram.",
          "Torongding has only two hotels. We stopped there for lunch. Expect accommodation prices to be close to Cheram and Anda Phedi. While we were there one of the hotels was closed. We eat in the teahouse on the left hand side. The owner of this guesthouse is the owner of the teahouse in Ramche and also the owner of one Yamphuding.",
          "Yamphuding is big a village but has a few hotels. Accommodation is nice; Rs 500 for a double or triple room. We stayed in Yalung Khang Guest House, where the owner is also the owner of the hotel in Cheram where we stayed. There is enough accommodation, including a four-bed dormitory.",
          "While in Khebang I noticed a nice homestay where we stop for lunch. In front of the school there is a homestay run by a teacher.",
          "Happo Khola is the place from where you can drive back to Birtamod. You do not need to trek on to Khamdime. The Buddha Hotel has a dorm with four-beds and two private rooms. It was Rs 500 for one twin bedroom and for one bed in the dorm."

The Tashi Lapcha Pass is perhaps the most difficult in this region, so a high level of fitness and stamina is required.",
          "This is reportedly one of the possible routes that people from Kham in Tibet used during the mid-1800’s. These people subsequently settled in this area and the Everest region and are now known as Sherpa. Therefore, this trek also has historical and cultural significance. After crossing the pass and coming into the Everest region, there are glorious views of Mount Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, Thamserku and Kusum Kangaru. And once reaching the bustling market town of Namche Bazaar there is an opportunity to interact with other trekking and climbing groups as well as the Sherpas.",

It was on the slopes of the Rolwaling Peak that Eric Shipton photographed Yeti footprints in 1951!",

The Tashi Lapcha Pass is perhaps the most difficult in this region, so a high level of fitness and stamina is required.",

These people subsequently settled in this area and the Everest region and are now known as Sherpa. Therefore, this trek also has historical and cultural significance. After crossing the pass and coming into the Everest region, there are glorious views of Mount Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, Thamserku and Kusum Kangaru. And once reaching the bustling market town of Namche Bazaar there is an opportunity to interact with other trekking and climbing groups as well as the Sherpas.",

It was on the slopes of the Rolwaling Peak that Eric Shipton photographed Yeti footprints in 1951!",

          "Recently I trekked Kanchenjunga in the month of May. Kanchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world and is located in Eastern Nepal. It borders Tibet and Sikkim. You can check my kanchenjunga circuit trip reporthere. I walked fifteen days clockwise around the Kanchenjunga massif. On the 4th day I arrived at the village of Ghunsa. At the guesthouse I was told that the body of a snow leopard have been discovered and people from the village have gone to retrieve it. I decided to stay one more day to see this unusual finding. So I waited. The next day the snow leopard was brought to the village, along with the horn of a blue sheep. So I went to examine this.",
          "I went to the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area Project Office where they have the body of the snow leopard. There was a police officer, conservation area officer and lots of local people. They were gathered there with much excitement and curiosity because it was such a rare event. I also was excited and curious. We were all allowed to touch the snow leopard and take a picture. I couldn’t believe how soft his fur and paws were. He was very white with black spot. He was beautiful. When I looked at him closely I could see broken teeth and puncture wounds.",
          "The police and conservation officers next proceeded to weigh and measure him. He was 9.2 kilo, nearly 3 feet long and they were able to pin point his age to be between eighteen and twenty month. After this they dug a whole and buried the body complete. They marked the grave with juniper plant. The blue sheep horn was placed in the office on display, and one day when you trek there you will be able to see this.",
          "After the burial there was a meeting between the officers and they made a report about the incident. The conclusion was that the snow leopard tried to attack the blue sheep and the blue sheep defended himself by attacking the leopard with his horns and killed him. Later, in the same location where the snow leopard was found there was a body of a blue sheep. It is most likely that the mother of the baby snow leopard came and killed the sheep."

On the way, there are some teashops on the flat areas, but there are only two hotels in Chirwa. At Rs 200 per person the hotels offer either dal bhat or noodles in a variety of ways (noodle soup, chowmein or thukpa). There is no other choice. What you can expect to pay for the food is Rs 300 for dal bhat, Rs 250 for thukpa, Rs 100 for a litre of hot water and Rs 40 for a big cup of black tea. Add Rs 50 if you want a cup of hot powdered milk.",

The flora and fauna of the park is diverse, including the endangered species of snow leopard, grey wolf, musk deer, and blue sheep, goral, great Tibetan sheep, Himalayan Tahr, leopard, jackal, and Himalayan black bear."
