For example, if you are planning on a trekking or climbing expedition in The Himalayas, your insurance must cover emergency air ambulance or helicopter rescue including medical expenses. For group tours in urban areas, ambulance or helicopter rescue is not mandatory, however it is recommended. In Tibet bound trips, there is no possibility of a helicopter rescue, thus it is not necessary for air ambulance coverage.

          "Climate\nThe climate of Nepal can be broadly divided into two seasons: The dry season runs from October to May and the wet (monsoon) season runs from June to September. Because of the varied topography, the weather in Nepal can vary from one region to another. As a general rule, temperatures fall and rainfall decreases the higher up we go. The most popular season to visit Nepal is the dry season i.e. October to May, with October and November recognized as having the best weather for trekking; the landscape is green and lush from the recent monsoon rains, the air is crisp and clean and the views of the Himalaya are crystal clear. During this season the nights are cold in the mountains, but the bright sun makes for pleasant daytime temperatures. At higher altitudes temperatures range from about 20 degree Centigrade down to -0 degree Centigrade at night. By early December winter is starting to creep in and the cold can be bitter and dangerous at high altitudes and the trails are often blocked by snow.\nThe pre monsoon period from May to early June is very hot and humid with temperatures soaring above 30 degree Centigrade. From mid June to September the monsoon rains lash Nepal turning the foothill trails into the mud river, rafting rivers become more furious and roads are often blocked by floods and landslides.",
          "Culture\nNepal’s location between India and Tibet, the diversity of its 60 or more ethnic groups, its isolating geography and myriad languages have resulted in a complex pattern of customs and beliefs. The dominant Nepali cultural concepts are those of caste and status, both of which contribute to a strictly defined system of hierarchy. Caste determines a person’s status and marriage partner. Nepal sweeps you along crooked, ancient streets flanked by dazzling, multi-roofed pagodas, gold-topped stupas and arcane stone sculptures, and into low-ceilinged rooms cluttered with horror-eyed masks, spinning prayer wheels, Buddhist thangka scrolls and Tibetan carpets. Either it is muttered chants of Buddhists monks in monastery or an early morning worship of Kathmandu’s housewife in a local temples, it is believed that the divine is everywhere. In Nepal, Hinduism and Buddhism is mingled wonderfully into a complex, syncretic blend like nowhere else.",
          "Insurance\nA travel insurance policy that covers medical expenses, evacuation, theft and loss is recommended. Make sure the insurance also covers all the adventure activities during your stay in Nepal.",
          "Money \nNepalese Rupees are found in denominations of 1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1 notes. Coins are found in denominations of 1, 2, 5 rupees. One rupee equals 100 paisa. Major international currencies, including the US dollar, euro and pounds sterling, are readily accepted. In Nepal the Indian rupee is also like a hard currency – the Nepali rupee is pegged to the Indian rupee at the rate of INRs 100 = NRs 160. Be aware that INRs 500 and INRs 1000 notes are not accepted anywhere in Nepal, apparently due to forgeries.

Points of Entry or Exit:\nThe point of entry and exit for the purpose of the foreigner entering into or departing from Nepal by obtaining a visa shall be as follows:\n1.    Immigration Office, Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu\n2.    Immigration Office, Kakarvitta, Jhapa (Eastern Nepal)\n3.    Immigration Office, Birganj, Parsa (Central Nepal)\n4.    Immigration Office, Kodari, Sindhupalchowk (Northern Border)\n5.    Immigration Office, Belahia, Bhairahawa (Rupandehi, Western Nepal)\n6.    Immigration Office, Jamunaha, Nepalgunj (Banke, Mid Western Nepal)\n7.    Immigration Office, Gaddachauki, Mahendranagar (Kanchanpur, Far Western Nepal)",
          "You can get up-to-date visa information at the website of the Department of Immigration (www.immi.gov.np).",
          "Getting into Nepal\nNepal is a traveller-friendly country and arrival is straightforward. All entry points to Nepal offer visas on arrival and money exchange. Since Nepal is a landlocked country and has India in its three sides and Tibet (China) in the north, entry to Nepal can be either by land or air.\nLand\nBy land there are six main entry points into Nepal: five from India and one from Tibet (China). Five entry points through India being Kakarbhitta, Birgunj, Bhairawa, Nepalgunj, and Mahendra Nagar and the Kodari Pass in Nepal-China border is the entry point to Nepal from China. There are no international bus or train services; everyone changes buses at the borders.\nAir\nKathmandu is the site of Nepal’s only international airport, Tribhuvan Airport.\nNepal Airlines is the national flag carrier of Nepal with flight connections to: Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore in India; Bangkok in Thailand; Osaka in Japan; Hong Kong, Shanghai in China; Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia; Dubai in United Arab Emirates and Singapore. Other international airlines connecting Kathmandu to other parts of the world are Biman Bangladesh to Dhaka in Bangladesh; China Airlines to Lhasa in Tibetan Autonomous Region of China; Druk Air to Paro in Bhutan and New Delhi in India; Gulf Air to Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates; Indian Airlines to Delhi, Kolkata, and Varanasi in India; Qatar Airways to Doha in Qatar; Thai International to Bangkok in Thailand.",
          "Health Information\nThe main health concern in Nepal is the high risk of acquiring either traveller’s diarrhoea, a respiratory infection or a more exotic tropical infection. Along with these diseases, it is recommended to gather information about the following infectious diseases too, while planning your trip to Nepal: Conjunctivitis, Hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, Rabies, Typhoid Fever and specially Altitude Sickness if you are planning to trek. As prevention is better than cure, it is recommended to drink purified water and eat in clean outlets only.",
          "Vaccinations\nAlthough Nepal does not officially require any immunisations for entry into the country, the risk of becoming ill can be reduced by obtaining the proper immunizations. Plan ahead and schedule your vaccinations as some require more than one injection, while others should not be given together. Vaccinations you should consider for a Nepal trip include the following: Diphtheria & Tetanus, Hepatitis A & B, Influenza, Japanese B Encephalitis (JBE), Meningococcal Meningitis, Polio, Rabies and Typhoid. The only vaccine required by international regulations is yellow fever, in case you have visited a country in the yellow fever zone within six days prior to entering Nepal.",
          "Medical checklist\nFollowing is a list of items you should consider including in your medical kit:\n•    aspirin or paracetamol (acetaminophen in the USA) for pain or fever\n•    antihistamine for allergies, eg hay fever; to ease the itch from insect bites or stings; and to prevent motion sickness\n•    cold and flu tablets, throat lozenges and nasal decongestant\n•    antibiotics, particularly if you’re travelling well off the beaten track; see your doctor, as antibiotics must be prescribed, and carry the prescription with you\n•    anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen) for muscle and joint overuse and pain; also for headache and fever\n•    loperamide or diphenoxylate ‘blockers’ for diarrhoea\n•    prochlorperazine or metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting\n•    insect repellent, sunscreen, lip balm and eye drops\n•    calamine lotion, sting-relief spray or aloe vera to ease irritation from sunburn and insect bites or stings\n•    antifungal cream or powder for fungal skin infections and thrush\n•    antiseptic (such as povidone-iodine) for cuts and grazes\n•    bandages, crepe wraps, Band-Aids (plasters) and other wound dressings\n•    water purification tablets or iodine\n•    scissors, tweezers and a thermometer",
          "Altitude Sickness\nAltitude Sickness either in the form of HAPE or HACE or sometime both can arise if we don’t give enough time to our body to adjust to higher altitudes with low oxygen concentration. Our bodies have the ability to adjust to higher altitudes if given enough time and this process is called acclimatization. If you are planning for trek at altitudes above 3000m, you should get information on preventing, recognizing and treating Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS).",
          "Types & Symptoms: In altitude sickness, fluid begins to leak from blood vessels, most often in the brain or in the lungs.",
          "HAPE (High Altitude Pulmonary Oedema) – If fluid collects in the lungs, you become breathless more easily while walking, and eventually more breathless at rest. Severe symptoms include breathlessness, dry, irritative cough which may progress to the production of pink, frothy sputum.",
          "HACE (High Altitude Cerebral Oedema) – If fluid collects in the brain, you initially develop a headache, loss of appetite, nausea and sometimes vomiting.",
          "HAPE or HACE can occur singly or in combination. If any one of these symptoms occurs, you become increasingly tired, develop a problem with your balance and coordination (ataxia). Eventually you lie down and slip into coma.",
          "Prevention:  The biggest risk factor for developing altitude sickness is going too high too quickly.  Therefore, ascend slowly and have frequent rest days, spending two to three nights at each rise of 1000m. Also, once above 3000m, care should be taken not to increase the sleeping altitude by more than 300m per day. Drink extra fluids, eat light, high-carbohydrate meals and avoid alcohol and sedatives.",
          "Rule 1: Learn the early symptoms of altitude sickness and be willing to recognize when you have them.\nRule 2: Never ascend to sleep at a new altitude with any symptoms of AMS.\nRule 3: Descend immediately if the symptoms are getting worse while resting at the same altitude.\nTreatment: Treat mild symptoms by resting at the same altitude until recovery, which usually takes a day or two. Paracetamol or aspirin can be taken for headaches. If symptoms persist or become worse, however, immediate descent is necessary; even 500m can help. Drug treatments should never be used to avoid descent or to enable further ascent.\nThe drugs acetazolamide and dexamethasone are recommended by some doctors for the prevention of AMS; however, their use is controversial. They can reduce the symptoms, but they may also mask warning signs; severe and fatal AMS has occurred in people taking these drugs."

          "Trekking is always a fun thing to choose, and it is fantastic when it comes to the Himalayas of Nepal. We need to be careful as sickness can be a problem sometimes. Here are some guidelines on staying healthy, consider the following advice, if you do get a sick consult with your assigned leader. The statement is written for our Nepal treks but applies almost equally for our India/Tibet and Bhutan treks.",
          "Arrival:",
          "If it comes to vacation, None of us like feeling tired or ill, traveling to a different time zone can be exciting, but due to the jetlag and everything makes us think the variation in how your body responds literally could be night and day. The most common symptoms of jet lag are sleepiness during the day and wakefulness during the night, headache, and stomach upset. There are things to prepare for time zone transitions; try to take it relaxed and calm and allow your body to fall into the current pattern.",
          "Drinking water:",
          "we are serious about hygiene on every trip. Clean drinking water, toilets are easily accessible in the developed countries, but we will not get such kind of privileged while trekking in the Himalayas. We will not be found luxuries While trekking in Nepal and Himalaya; however, there is a clean toilet in most of the Teahouse on the trek. Mineral water, boiled water, or water with Iodine is safe to drink while we are up in the Himalaya. Our team will take care of those essential, so there is nothing to worry about it.",
          "Purifying Water:",
          "There are lots of contaminated water we can found in the streams and rivers of Nepal, to achieve purely potable water, several technologies must combine in a sequence. We will not prefer you to drink water without high precautions up in the Himalaya. Only water made from clean snow is safe and has brought to heat, 5000m/16,404ft, is reliable to drink. Water only needs to purify at 75ÂºC/162ÂºF. At 5800m/19,000ft, water boils at around 81ÂºC/177ÂºF so all tea, coffee, and hot lemon, etc. is safe to drink. There are many different methods to purify water; in the lodges, boiled water usually is available, while camping, our crew members provide thermos of boiled water. Sometimes you may want to clean water yourself; the most convenient method is Iodine tablets. If you have a water filter, ask us if it is worthwhile to carry it.",
          "Diarrhea:",
          "Most of the developing countries’ common problem is diarrhea, especially India & Nepal. We might face this problem may be due to climate change or the food our body is not familiar with the chosen environment. Usually, when we get diarrhea, seeing a doctor is the first option, but while trekking, we will not find a doctor, so we need to follow the precaution. So, what recommended: is when we were not able to find the medical treatment, we will go with the available remedies for the procedure. First, we need to be clam because sometimes people cannot understand and choose to take pills at the first loose bowels. Instead, our team will support the individual to be hydrated and follow the guide’s remedies. Let us wait for a few days and see what happens. Unless it is particularly awful, there is no need to stop trekking; drinking lots of water and making our body hydrated is a good option. Only choose to eat when you are hungry and taking lots of light, and soupy food is the best part. Diarrhea is still becoming trouble for a few days, and You may seek some treatment. We advised being careful and informed of any history of stomach ulcers, gall bladder problems, previously perforated intestine, etc. where we will follow the recommended remedies by the expert.",
          "Giardia:",
          "Common in Nepal and Himalaya. It is usually from infected water, especially from Kathmandu and high mountain streams near where yaks graze. It generally takes 7-10 days to develop and does not come on suddenly. The classic symptoms are very sulfurous (rotten egg) smelling farts and burps. The other symptoms that make it easier to distinguish from different types of diarrhea are rumbling, churning, upset stomach, sometimes cramping and bloating, and no fever, chills, or nausea. In these last couple of years, giardia has also introduced different symptoms.",
          "watery diarrhea:",
          "Giardia can also be virtually symptomless, just occasional soft stools or constipation even and a vaguely upset stomach. Some forms your body will clear given a month or so, and several people have had it without realizing, however, if it is visible and a problem, two drugs are effective. Tiniba – this can be bought at all Nepalese pharmacies (without a prescription). The name of the active chemical is Tinidazole. The dose is 2 grams, i.e., 4 x 500 mg (milligrams)) all at once, then 24 hours later, the same dose, and 24 hours later, a third dose. It is perhaps better taken in the evening due to the usual side effects, a strong metallic taste in your mouth and nausea may cause slept off. This dose is about 90% effective – it may re-occur later. Do not mix with alcohol. Alternatively, take Flagyl/Metronidazole. The treatment is 250mg three times a day for 5 to 7 days. It is not allowed with alcohol. Note! DONT take Flagyl and Tiniba at the same time.",
          "Amoebic Dysentery:",
          "Occasionally, its onset is sudden and weakens a person severely, sometimes to the point of barely being able to lift oneself off the toilet. However, it usually comes on slowly, mild diarrhea that comes and goes, something that can almost, but not entirely, can be ignored. When it is most dangerous because the symptoms can eventually clear up, but your body is still infested and slowly damaged. If you suspect you have this, upon returning to Kathmandu, we will move forward with the bowel test. According to Dr. David Schlim of CIWEC clinic, Kathmandu, it causes perhaps 1% or less of all diarrhea cases in Nepal.",
          "Travelers / Bacterial Diarrhea:",
          "The onset often accompanied by fever, chills, and nausea; next is relatively sudden frequent watery diarrhea and often cramps. It can be by slightly different strains of bacteria that your body is adopted. This type of infection is usually the first to attack fresh from home arrivals to Nepal. There are two methods of treatment. Your body generally copes with foreign bacteria quite well, so it should clear up given plenty of time. However, the usual Nepalese version is more reliable than many, so particularly useful is to begin a short course of Norfloxacin, under the name Normaflox or Norbactin in Nepal. The dose is 400mg every 12 hours for three days. An often-recommended drug is Bactrim / Bactrim DS or Septra. There are now resistant strains, so they are not nearly as effective, and similarly, there is increasing resistance to Cipro, so another drug is becoming the standard treatment. See a doctor in Kathmandu.",
          "Food Poisoning:",
          "Food Poisoning comes on suddenly and severely, and common symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea. It happens about 4 to 8 hours after eating the contaminated food. Luckily, it usually lasts less than 24 hours, and recovery is quick, although you may feel weakened. There are no drugs that can help – the body just must eject all the contaminated food and rid itself of the poison. Rest and, once the first severe bout or two are over, drink plenty of fluids. Oral rehydration solutions are helpful.",
          "Other Medical Problem",
          "Dehydration:",
          "While trekking lower down in the valleys, it is hot, and you sweat a lot, so it is essential to replace the fluids you lose. At altitude, the problem is worse, you are still sweating, and the air is dry and thin, meaning you must breathe a lot harder. With every breath, you breathe out water vapor. It is crucial then to drink a lot. Dehydration makes you feel tired and lethargic and can give you a headache. The symptoms are like AMS, so the easiest way to avoid confusion is always to keep hydrated.",
          "The basic rules are drink as much and as often as you like (that does not include alcohol!) even if it seems like a lot. We suggest the consist of soups and lots of tea, and much liquid food, you should include a lot of water too. Many people find that with dinner, they often drink more than a liter of water, catching up on what they should have drunk during the day. A great guideline is an expression: A happy mountaineer always pees clear!",
          "The easiest way to check that you are not becoming dehydrated is to look at your urine; if it is very yellow or orange, you should drink more, but if it is almost transparent, you have been looking after yourself well. Using this as a guideline, some trekkers find that, although they do not feel thirsty, their urine is yellow. Overall, it means trying to be hydrate even if you must think about it consciously.",
          "The Khumbu Cough:",
          "If trekking for a prolonged period at altitude, especially in the Everest region: If you escape the Khumbu Cough, you did very well. It is the perpetually running nose and a usually mild productive cough caused by breathing excess quantities of dry cold air – so much that you partially injure your bronchi. A cold or infection is the usual cause of this, but in this case, the irritant is only air; however, your body reacts almost identically – quantities of clear or white goo. Get rid of it when you can, there is plenty more waiting to well up. Since there is no infection, it is pointless taking antibiotics. Throat lozenges help, so bring plenty.",
          "Bronchitis:",
          "Inflammation of the bronchi from an infection, i.e., identical to the Khumbu coughs but instead caused by a virus. Differentiating this from the Khumbu Cough is difficult, but you perhaps experienced a fever and some chills. The cough may be more productive. Since it can be a viral or bacterial infection, taking antibiotics will not always help and is not particularly recommended. Best is some rest and a return to a lower altitude, e.g., Namche, and see a doctor if it is particularly bad.",
          "Pneumonia:",
          "Pneumonia is an infection that causes fluid to build up in the lungs. It is rare, but once HAPE was miss-diagnosed as pneumonia, and since the treatment was antibiotics, rather than descent, most people died.",
          "Cold/snow injuries",
          "Snow Blindness:",
          "Snow Blindness is the sunburn of the cornea. It is particularly painful, like hot sand in your eyes. It is entirely preventable by wearing sunglasses that block UV light. This precaution is most important while around snow, even on cloudy days, but altitude alone increases the concentration of UV light, so while at higher elevations, also wear sunglasses. Porters often get snow blindness. If sunglasses are not available, then cardboard shields shaped like glasses with two narrow slits for vision are easily made and are quite useful.",
          "Frostbite:",
          "When flesh freezes solid, the results are severe, and often amputation is necessary. Frostbite takes time to develop unless pulp gets exposed to a vicious cold wind. First, your fingers or toes feel numb, clumsy, and lose power. If you can still vaguely wiggle them, then warm them up now, they are on the verge of freezing. Rewarming is painful. When real deep freezing has occurred, the flesh turns white or even blue, and fingers or toes become wooden, incapable of movement. At this stage, do not begin rewarming until the refreezing cannot occur (even more damaging). Warm slowly and evenly. Blood temperature to 42ºC is the optimum warming temperature, and once defrosted promotes blood circulation. Blisters will probably form. See a doctor as soon as possible.",
          "Bugs, blisters, and skin problems",
          "Fleas, bedbugs, and scabies: These problem bugs are almost unknown on our treks. The trekking regions of Nepal are considerably cleaner than years ago.",
          "Leeches:",
          "The monsoon terrorizer. You must admire the skill in being able to put a sizeable hole in you entirely painlessly. In the damp forest, wave around waiting for you and are adept at penetrating socks and even boot eyelets. They can remove by applying a lighted match or cigarette to the end still sticking out.",
          "Blisters:",
          "Since you spend most of your time walking, blisters are worth avoiding. First, use boots that have worn in if possible. Test your shoes by carrying a pack up and down hills – along level ground, and there is far less stress on your feet. Usually, you can feel a blister developing – some rubbing, or a hot spot, or localized pain. Stop and investigate, even if it occurs during the first 5 minutes, or just in sight of the top of the hill; immediate action is best. The trick is to detect the symptoms before the blister develops. Put tape on or investigate what may cause the problem.",
          "Blister Treatment – If you develop a blister, then there are several approaches. If it is not painful, then perhaps surround it (not cover it) with some light padding, e.g., moleskin, and see how it feels. If it is painful and causing problems, then pierce it – clean the skin and sterilize it; holding the needle slightly above a candle or match flame for a second or two is adequate. Do not cut away the blistered skin until after a few days when dried out and no more used to protect the delicate skin underneath. Put protective tape over the top with some cotton wool to protect the blister. Some people even put the tape straight over the blister, with no protection if you have had a previous history of blisters or think that you are likely to get them to take preventative action first! Use moleskin, a durable waterproof zinc-oxide tape or similar, and tape up troublesome areas first—tape before you make your first step and be religious about checking, and replacing, the tape. Vaginal infections If you have experienced these before, then it is very worthwhile taking along the medication just in case.",
          "Precautions and Inoculations discussion",
          "This information is given in good faith but with NO responsibility. It was written for our Nepal treks but applied almost equally for our Tibet/Bhutan and India treks.",
          "Precautions:",
          "Anyone with heart, lung, and blood pressure abnormalities or a continuing medical condition should have a check-up and get a medical opinion before setting off.",
          "Older people:",
          "Many recently retired people have made it to the top of Kala Pattar (5554m/18,222ft), so age is not a barrier. The earlier you are, the more crucial prior fitness preparation is.",
          "Younger children: Caution should be applied when taking children trekking. Younger people can be slower to adapt to altitude, and young children have difficulty in communicating exactly how they feel. No studies have undertaken, so doctors recommend the safe maximum for pre-teenage children is 3000m/9843ft. However, several young children have made it to the top of Kala Pattar – 5560m. Trekking with children can be rewarding and bring you closer to the locals. You share a common bond, for there are few people without children in Nepal. Little legs are easily carried by a porter when tired, and Sherpanis are good babysitters.",
          "Teenagers:",
          "There is no evidence to suggest that teenagers adapt slower to altitude than adults. However, they do appear to be more at risk. It is likely because of competitiveness, and a will not give in, and some school groups treat the trek as an outward-bound exercise, with everyone carrying their backpack. School groups should allow an extra day or two over the most conservative itineraries and be particularly watchful.",
          "Asthma:",
          "Asthma cannot be a reason to say no to the trekking. Except in polluted Kathmandu, there are fewer air irritants, so most asthmatics feel better while trekking. Look after your medication – wear your inhaler on a chain around your neck or keep it in a pocket. There is still a reasonable risk of a severe attack, so brief your companions on what to do.",
          "Diabetes:",
          "If it is well-controlled, diabetes is no reason to avoid trekking. You cannot afford to lose the medication, so always keep it with you and warn you, friends, on the procedures in case there is an emergency. Your increased energy expenditure will change carbohydrate and insulin levels, so it is imperative to monitor your glucose levels frequently and carefully and to keep blood sugar levels well controlled.",
          "High blood pressure (hypertension):",
          "Blood pressure will fluctuate more and be higher than usual while on a trek. You should seek the advice of a doctor who is aware of the history of your condition.",
          "Previous heart attacks: Studies have yet to conduct, but the level of activity required on a trek is more significant than the altitude factor. Seek the advice of your doctor.",
          "Epilepsy: There is a moderately increased risk of a seizure at altitude, but it is not a reason to stop you trekking. Your companions must brief on all the relevant procedures.",
          "Pregnancy:",
          "Complications are common, especially in the first pregnancy. Sometimes sophisticated care is needed, so it is probably not a good idea to go trekking while pregnant. The effects of reduced oxygen at high altitudes on the fetus have not yet studied.",
          "History of chest infections: If you are prone to these, bring the medicine you usually prescribed (usually Augmentin or Roxi-something), and at least two full courses. If you are ascending to high altitude for only a short time in the Everest region, you may want to take it prophylactically, since your chances of picking one up are high.",

It is worth reading very carefully and printing this advice out, plus what follows, before getting your shots. American doctors (perhaps to avoid getting sued) tend to jab far more needles than is useful. The best people to consult about the vaccinations currently recommended are clinics specializing in travel medicine. They will have access to more up-to-date information than a standard general practitioner.",
          "Hepatitis A:",
          "Usually passed on in contaminated water; immunization is considered a must by most doctors unless you have had hepatitis A before. The vaccine is Havrix, and a full course will give up to ten years of protection.",

          "Rabies:",
          "This deadly virus we got by the bite of an infected animal like monkey or dog. The risk of being bitten is minimal, but it has happened. A vaccination is available, but even if you have had it, you will then need a follow-up course of two further injections. If you have not been vaccinated and are unlucky enough to be bitten, a series of vaccinations is available only from the CIWEC clinic in Kathmandu. It should start within a week or so of being bitten.",
          "Malaria:",
          "Carried only by the lowland Anopheles mosquito, disease exists in the Terai in Nepal (i.e., below 1000m/3281ft), and across much of the rest of rural Asia. There is no risk in Kathmandu or while trekking, and Pokhara’s uncertainty appears to be only theoretical. If visiting Chitwan April to October, then you can consider taking tablets to protect against malaria. The actual risk, especially since you are there for a short time, is minimal, and the side effects of some drugs less than the minimum. Whether you are or are not taking antimalarials, the first line of protection is to avoid biting. The Anopheles mosquito is active only between early evening and dawn, so you should cover up well between these times and use mosquito repellent on any exposed skin. All the better lodges at Chitwan spray the whole compound regularly with mosquito-killing chemicals. I am always staggered by the number of people taking antimalarial medication who should not be. The side effects of some of the more potent drugs can be quite nasty, so especially if you are going climbing or trekking, you should not be taking them. Ask your doctor about this.",
          "If you are behind on any of the immunizations listed above, they can safely obtain at clinics in Kathmandu.",
          "Medical insurance:",
          "A combined travel/medical insurance policy is a sensible choice for any traveler and a requirement for most tours, please take this insurance in your home country."

          "However, for the foreigners, if they don’t have Nepali missions and embassies in their countries and are facing difficulties to obtain visas, they are allowed to apply for on-arrival visas at Kathmandu Tribhuvan International Airport. On-arrival visas are not granted for tourists coming overland.",
          "According to the new rules, tourists seeking on-arrival visas should submit at least four documents at the airlines check-in counters, before boarding the flight to Nepal. The documents are PCR negative report taken 72 hours prior to their departure, documents proving they are vaccinated with full dose; a copy of a recommendation letter issued by the Nepal Tourism Board and Department of Tourism; proof of hotel booking in Nepal; and travel insurance covering emergency search and rescue and treatment throughout their stay in Nepal.",

Most of them arrived before the country imposed entry restrictions on March 20.",

Also, if you want to spend some quality time before moving back, Nepal offers you a wide variety of possibilities. Best Day Tours in Nepal are the greatest way to explore our natural beauty and its cultural side. If you are an adventure lover, then this one day would be bewildering and so enough.",
          "How to spend a day in Kathmandu?\nAs a one-day tourist in Kathmandu, you can have sightseeing options around the area. Even though Nepal has a reputation for dusty streets and heavy traffics, but Day tours in Nepal are possible, trust me.",
          "Booking your reservations for one of the best day tours in Nepal is a very good idea, and the Alpine Club of Himalaya serves you similar facilities. However, walking alone along the peaceful & calming area gives different vibes.",
          "You can easily get public buses to make your travel a bit quicker to utilize your time at its best, or personal bike riding can also be available easily.",
          "Although most tourists prefer staying In the Thamel area due to the presence of travel-friendly restaurants, travel agencies, and souvenir shops, Thamel seems like a whole different world than any other area in Kathmandu.",
          "Wherever you stay, here is a guide for spending your day as best day tours in Nepal in Nepali style.\nNepal’s traffic is as bad as Nepal is good at honoring tourists. The places that might look closer can even take hours because of traffic conditions. So rather than hopping between lots of options, it is best you first decide what you want to explore.",
          "A Day in Kathmandu\nStarting a day spiritually, the best thing you can do first in the morning visits Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu. This religious site is one of the UNESCO-listed temples famous for everyone, especially Hindus.",
          "You will be charged for visiting the temple, but this holiest Hindu site shows you the phase of life. There are cremation sites on the bank of the holy Bagmati River where people are burned when they die.\nWhereas at one side people are dancing to the music of the devotional song, some are crying because they have to bid goodbye to someone they love forever.",

          "After a wonderful cup of coffee, walk around the Patan museum or Basantapur area. Anyone can help you with directions, or you can easily get rides. The Patan museum shows the traditional sacred arts of Nepal in an illustrious architectural setting. Patan museum is one of the best museums in South Asia.",
          "1-PM in Kathmandu\nSuppose you are still active enough to have a tummy full of Daal Bhat(Nepali Traditional Food). You can choose your options of traveling. Boudanath Stupa, Chandragiri Hills, Swayambhu Nath, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Nagarkot, etc., are some options you can easily explore throughout your day.",
          "But if you don’t want to get very tired, move towards the Boudanath Stupa. A beautiful UNESCO-listed Heritage situated in Boudha looks so inspiring. A must-visit for Buddhist people, Boudanath Stupa holds a special place in the heart of each Nepali.",
          "Boudanath Stupa is one of the holiest Tibetan Buddhist sites. The marble white color with beautiful Buddha Eyes at the top looks just mesmerizing. Explore this place during sunset because the shadow of the falling sun makes it even more glorious. It is a tradition to walk clockwise around the Boudhanath Stupa or other Buddhist places.",
          "Save some time for shopping because Boudha has an amazing collection of gifts you can take to your place as a memory. Prayer flags, incense burners, Tibetan jewelry, paintings, etc., can be some of the options you can love.",
          "5:30 PM in Kathmandu\nSo I guess it’s time to have some snacks. Boudha is a place with some amazing restaurants that serve you delicious food along with a dazzling view. Eat something famous. Momo(Dumplings) is one of the best snacks for Nepali people. But if you want to explore Tibetian or Italian food, there are plenty of options.",
          "7:30-PM under the starts\nIf you want to feel free from everything, head back to Pasupatinath for Sandhya Arati(Evening Prayer). Sandhya Arati at Pasupatinath with an open sky in the open air is just unforgettable. Many people gather there for prayer, and trust me; it will be one of the most beautiful moments you have ever had in Nepal.",
          "But if you want to bang off your head with some modern pop music, move towards to Thamel or Durbarmarg area. Kathmandu’s nightlife is amazing but mostly around the tourist area. You can easily find so many options to catch rock cover bands.",
          "It is no problem to get back to your hotel room even when it’s late. You can easily get taxis or private rides but make sure they won’t charge you a lot. Also, pickpockets are quite common.",
          "What can be the other options to spend an Active Day in Kathmandu?\nIf you are an outdoor activity lover, one day for you would be enough. You can have options of Paragliding, Zipline, Bungee jumping, Cycling, Rock Climbing, and many more.",
          "The best thing is to hire a guide anytime who can help you through all this. Most Trekking Agencies like Alpine Club of Himalaya offer you a guide to help you spend your day most beneficially. Hiring a tourist guide from the Alpine Club of Himalaya is not only suitable for your security but is pocket-friendly."

          "EBC offers you the gentle mixture of Nepalese hospitality, beautiful yet challenging trails, a wide range of the awe-inspiring Himalayas, and many more.",
          "When should I make a plan for trekking?",
          "Besides knowing how to trek to EBC, you should also be prepared to make plans. The traveling seasons surely do impact. The possible time for trekking to EBC can be from March-May or September to December.",
          "However, May is quite hot, but the trails are all filled with rhododendron forests. Make sure you prepare for a surprise rain if you travel during May.",
          "Again, if you plan to trek to December, remember the temperature gets very low; however, the days are stunning as the sun feels so good on the body, and during this time, the trails are not so busy and crowded.",
          "Do I need a guide to Trek to EBC?",
          "Probably not. Even the altitude is tough, but the trails to EBC are not very hard on people. You surely do not need a guide, but a porter will be of big help. But even if you go for a trekking guide, it would be no wrong because it is always better to be with someone who knows more. You can easily hire trekking guides from the Alpine Club of Himalaya.",

          "Acclimatization is often important, or else you might fall sick easily. Even though the trek to EBC only requires average fitness, it is always better to prepare yourself rather than complain about how your legs hurt.",
          "You can trail yourself by doing some easy exercise for several weeks before heading towards your destination. Focus on running, stair climbing, and little hiking can help.",
          "Since most people get altitude sickness and breathing shortness as you trek to higher altitudes, before you go for a week, prepare yourself for yoga to help you breathe better.",
          "Make sure you do not walk continuously and acclimatize well along the journey. Don’t forget to take medications if you are on some. Always travel with a guide if you have health issues that occur at heights.",
          "How can I Pack Bags?",
          "How to pack your bags, along with knowing how to trek to Everest Base Camp, depends greatly on which season you are traveling. Since you trek to the Everest region, the climate will get colder and colder as you reach heights.",
          "Don’t forget to pack layers rather than bulky clothes and heavy shampoo bottles. Pack your most comfortable pair of trousers rather than jeans. You surely don’t want to complain about uncomfortable clothes when enjoying the views.",
          "Pack some good thermals, fleece jacket, and 2-3 synthetic fiber tees. A raincoat or something to help you with quick rain along with a down jacket would be good. Don’t forget to carry good pair of shoes and a comfortable spare one.",
          "You will also need a woolen hat, gloves, and polarized sunglasses. You should be able to carry a warm sleeping bag and trekking poles. If you trek, buying good gear is also better, but if you don’t hire them in Kathmandu to save up some money.",
          "Apart from that, dry shampoo, good sunscreen, lip balm, water bottle, some cash, your emergency medications, adhesive bandages, and something you think is essential, and you are good to go.",

Also, you need to manage your budget for visas, trekking gear, and international flight tickets.",

          "How difficult is it to complete Everest Base Camp?",
          "Trekking along the inclined trails and carrying heavy baggage is not a simple task. But with prior training and exercise, it is possible to complete the trek without any problems. Unlike much other trekking, the Everest Base Camp Trek begins at 2850 m and takes you up to the altitude of 5632m which is an admirable height. So, you must acclimate to the altitude.",

          "Best time to climb Mera peak in Nepal- Weather, and climate: Mera Mountain, at 6470 meters, is the highest trekking peak in Nepal. This, combined with the fact that it provides unrivaled views and breathtaking panoramas, makes this trekking peak one of Nepal’s most famous mountaineering destinations. Mera Peak isn’t rugged in terms of technical difficulty, but the altitude makes for an exciting and challenging trek.",
          "The ice waterfalls, lush forests, grazing meadows, and spectacular glaciers, in addition to the high summits, are breathtaking. In addition, the diverse flora and wildlife are distinctive. Furthermore, the welcoming Sherpas will greet you with their traditional cultures.",
          "In this blog, we’ll discuss the best time to climb Mera Peak in Nepal- the weather and climate of the region around Mera Peak in Nepal. The keys to success in the mountains, we believe, are excellent acclimatization and physical conditioning.",
          "Mera Peak may produce a wide range of meteorological conditions at any time of year. You must be experienced and prepared for various weather circumstances because the weather is never guaranteed to be stable. In contrast, you must ensure you have the proper mountaineering footwear and equipment for this chilly and hazardous terrain.",
          "Our client successfully completing Mera Peak",
          "You can plan a trek to Mera peak with Alpine Club of Himalaya. We will help you with everything, including equipment, kit, and guide to climbing Mera peak.",
          "It’s critical to choose the correct weather and time. Your planning, preparations, and hard work will provide the intended results when you choose the right time. Climbing Mera Summit or any other peak at the wrong moment is the most straightforward way to waste your time and effort even though.",
          "Not only that but climbing Mera Peak at the incorrect time will prevent you from exploring Mera Peak’s heavenly home, the Khumbu region. The world’s three tallest peaks, including Mt Everest and Mt Lhotse, including other peaks, picturesque terrains, and lush vegetation, are all found in Khumbu. As a result, choosing the optimal time to climb Mera Peak isn’t a bad idea.",
          "Climbing Mera Peak is possible for both novice and experienced climbers. The weather at high elevations is often unreliable. The combination of this weather and the frigid temperatures adds to the thrill and excitement of climbing Mera Peak.",
          "A season is never a barrier for an avid trekker but rather a challenge and inspiration to make the most of the experience. However, if you are a beginner, it is preferable to climb Mera Peak during the best season.",
          "Trekking and Climbing in Nepal are best done in the autumn and spring, so it is also the best time to climb Mera peak in Nepal.",
          "Late April, May, late September, October, and November are the best months to climb Mera Peak. The ideal months to climb Mera Peak are May and October, according to our experience. If you want to climb in late March or early April, or late October or early November, be prepared for colder weather. In any of these months, it may snow. As a result, you’ll need to modify your clothes and equipment for the cooler temps you’ll encounter on the Mera Peak climb.",
          "Autumn officially begins in September. In early September, you can still experience the leftovers of the monsoon. All of the rivers, waterfalls, and lakes in the area will be at their most beautiful. Many streams and waterfalls are visible that aren’t seen during the other months.",
          "You can also take in the fresh air’s beautiful green forest and vegetation. After the monsoon, the air is likewise crisp and fresh. During the autumn, the average daytime temperature is around 12 degrees Celsius. The temperature dips to roughly 6-8 degrees Celsius at night.",
          "By mid-November, the average temperature had begun to fall. You’ll need an extra set of warm clothes for this. Insulated jackets, waterproof coats, and boots fall within this category. Light snowfall is possible at the end of November.",
          "Autumn offers some of the most consistent, dry, and clear weather of the year. During this period, you get the finest of everything. The Mera Peak trek is spectacular in the autumn, with beautiful skies and magnificent sunrises and sunsets. As a result, the trails are busiest during this time of year.",
          "The best time to climb Mera peak in Nepal during the spring is beneficial for nature enthusiasts.",
          "The flowers are in full bloom at this time. Rhododendron and other wildflower blossoms abound in the lower reaches of Mera Peak. Alpine vegetation may contain some stunning flora and fauna.",
          "In addition, the weather is clean and dry, with excellent visibility. Forests ablaze with crimson, pink, and white blossoms make for stunning photographs. The temperatures begin to rise in March. With this, the snow on the trails will begin to melt. Snow puddles can still be found on the paths in March.",
          "Make sure to bring a rain jacket and pants with you. During mountain treks, traction spikes become essential equipment.",
          "The average daily temperature in the spring is 10 degrees Celsius. During the night, the temperature drops to -4 degrees Celsius. Make sure to bring a down jacket with you. The weather in March is still chilly. The jacket will also be useful on chilly nights and early mornings.",
          "Mera Peak’s off-seasons Climbing is when the trails to Mera summit are mostly unoccupied at certain year periods. Harsh weather, rain, cold temperatures, snowfall, and other factors are blamed for these events. In other words, the weather is not in a climber’s favor; rather, it creates trouble for them. Monsoon, i.e., summer and winter, are two seasons that are considered off-season.",
          "To conclude, the Mera trek is a good choice for anyone looking to complete their first Himalayan climb or gain mountaineering experience with minimal to intermediate climbing skills.",
          "Mera Peak can be reached by a variety of itineraries and trekking paths. Please do not hesitate to contact Alpine Club of Himalaya if you have any questions regarding the Mera Peak climb or any other treks or tours in Nepal."
